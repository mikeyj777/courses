8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,060
PROFESSOR: So I am
going to start this talk

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,340
by explaining the title.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,620
So we'll start with
active learning.

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,420
What is active learning?

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,180
In my mind, it's this
pretty broad term.

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,000
It's a form of learning that
attempts to involve students

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,916
more directly in the
learning process.

15
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,290
And there are all
sorts of things

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,780
that fall under the
umbrella of active learning.

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,790
So things like having
students engage in group

18
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,540
work, in class-wide
discussions, in debates,

19
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,690
acting out certain concepts,
group problem solving

20
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,580
sessions, all of these things.

21
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,200
And so in all of
those activities,

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,180
students are engaged.

23
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,610
They're not passively
listening to a lecture,

24
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,050
they're actively participating.

25
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,060
And there is some evidence
that this style of learning

26
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,350
is good for a lot of things.

27
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,630
There is evidence to support
the effectiveness of student

28
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,740
engagement in exam
scores, failure rates, how

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,220
well students remember content,
student attitudes, study

30
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,430
habits.

31
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,970
And there's also evidence
that active learning

32
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,090
has a disproportionate benefit
for minorities, students

33
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,330
from disadvantaged
backgrounds, female students,

34
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,430
and male dominated fields.

35
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,970
So there's evidence that active
learning creates this more

36
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,230
inclusive environment.

37
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,660
So it's this wide, wide
variety of techniques reported

38
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,390
to have a lot of benefits.

39
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,230
So that's active learning.

40
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,240
Now, what is 6.033?

41
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,820
So 6.033 is computer
systems engineering.

42
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,510
It's a required class
for all computer science

43
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,870
majors, which means as a
result, at MIT it's quite large.

44
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,620
So like Dipa said, we
have about 400 students.

45
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,850
It runs once a year.

46
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,180
So every spring we
get 400 new students.

47
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,850
Most of them are
juniors and seniors.

48
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,050
And in some ways, 033
is a typical MIT class.

49
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,800
We have lectures twice a week.

50
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,860
We have recitations
twice a week.

51
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,290
But in most other ways, 033
is not a typical MIT class.

52
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,840
For one, it's a CIM class.

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,470
So it's a Communications
Intensive in the Major class.

54
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,630
That means that most
of our assignments

55
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,110
are based around writing
or oral presentations.

56
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,840
It's not a class where students
are implementing or building

57
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,490
a lot of things.

58
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,000
We focus heavily on
reading and on writing.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,690
In particular, we have
tutorial sections each week,

60
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,810
dedicated to the
communication material,

61
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,020
taught by dedicated
communication staff.

62
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,160
The major assignment in
033 is a design project.

63
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,690
It takes most of the semester.

64
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,380
The students completed in
teams, usually teams of three.

65
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,470
And it's comprised of a
few written assignments

66
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,450
and oral presentations.

67
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,500
One of our big focuses for that
project is getting students

68
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,770
to recognize the trade-offs
they need to make when they're

69
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,140
designing a system,
and getting them

70
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,730
to defend those trade-offs.

71
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,140
So this is not
just a class about

72
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,410
how computer systems work,
but how we design them,

73
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,930
how we decide what
choices to make when

74
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,970
we're building those systems.

75
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,280
So the last thing that
makes 033 pretty unique,

76
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,800
and is what I'm largely
going to talk about here,

77
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,770
is that our recitation
sections are pretty intense.

78
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,250
They are taught by faculty,
senior research staff.

79
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,980
We have about 25
students per section.

80
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,380
So you are right to think
that, oh, my gosh, they have

81
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,720
like 18 sections per semester.

82
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,540
We do.

83
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,970
It's a lot.

84
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,690
Each recitation focuses
around a technical paper

85
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,240
that the students
have read beforehand.

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,190
And the goal for those
discussion sections,

87
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,030
those recitations, is for them
to be largely discussion based.

88
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,550
And in fact, that has
always been the goal of 033.

89
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,470
033 has been around for
almost 50 years at this point.

90
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,480
It's been around since
before I was born.

91
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,270
And the goal has always
been for these recitations

92
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,100
to be discussion based.

93
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,649
During the recitations,
we're talking about,

94
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:20,709
we talk about the system
that the paper describes--

95
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,920
does it work?

96
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
What were the trade-offs
that the authors made?

97
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,160
Do we like this system?

98
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,900
How would you
design this system?

99
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,840
All right, so that is 033.

100
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,800
Now, why put active
learning into 033?

101
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,370
And you might think that it's
just because, well, there's

102
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,910
evidence that active
learning can be a good idea,

103
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,160
so why not try it?

104
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,250
That's fair.

105
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,260
We were actually trying to
solve a pretty specific problem

106
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,960
in the class though.

107
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,180
So like I said,
ideally the recitations

108
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,670
are based heavily
around discussion.

109
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,100
And again, that has
always been the goal.

110
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,910
Because this is a class about
system design, not just about

111
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,460
how these systems work,
one way that we teach

112
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,480
that is by having the
students analyze and critique

113
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,280
existing systems
before they go out

114
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,910
and try to design their own.

115
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,570
And so, what are the
goals of the designers?

116
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,640
Does the system
meet those goals?

117
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,290
Are those goals important?

118
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,119
If you were redesigning the
system, how would you do it?

119
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,160
What would your goals be?

120
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,784
What trade-offs would
you have to make?

121
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,130
Things like that.

122
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,350
A large part of that
instruction happens

123
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,910
in the recitation, where we're
having these discussions.

124
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,430
And they go and
apply those skills

125
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,350
to their design projects.

126
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,070
So to get that to happen, it's
important that the students are

127
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,290
engaged in recitation,
that they're

128
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,810
reading the paper beforehand,
they're asking questions,

129
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,018
they're answering questions,
they're coming prepared,

130
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:46,082
things like that.

131
00:05:46,082 --> 00:05:48,690
And for a long time, that
was not happening for us.

132
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,000
We had a lot of
trouble with this.

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,230
We found that students weren't
willing to volunteer answers.

134
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,540
When we'd ask them a question,
nobody would raise their hand.

135
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,960
We found that some of
them weren't even reading

136
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,370
the paper beforehand.

137
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,280
So they're just kind
of coming in confused.

138
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,410
As a result of all of
this, our instructors

139
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,140
would end up spending
the first 15, 20, 25

140
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,710
minutes of the recitation
lecturing about the paper,

141
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,070
because so many of the
students didn't come prepared.

142
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,680
And then that just made things
worse, as you can imagine.

143
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,381
Students know that they're
going to come into recitation,

144
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,880
that they're going
to get a lecture,

145
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,490
so why bother reading the paper,
if your instructor is just

146
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,615
going to explain it to you.

147
00:06:27,615 --> 00:06:30,330
And so it was just kind
of making things worse.

148
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,570
We weren't getting to teach
the material that we really

149
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,700
needed to teach, because
we were spending time

150
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,470
rehashing these papers.

151
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,350
The students
weren't learning how

152
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,100
to read these papers,
how to analyze them,

153
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,360
how to critique them.

154
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,590
And honestly, it
wasn't much fun.

155
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,960
It wasn't all that much
fun to teach this way.

156
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,820
Occasionally, we could get a
discussion going in a class.

157
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,210
But we would then encounter
another problem, which

158
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,480
is pretty common, where
we'd have a discussion,

159
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,680
but it would be dominated
by two or three students

160
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,260
in the room, the same
two or three students.

161
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,540
And then other students
are tuning out,

162
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,020
or even becoming sort of
visibly uncomfortable,

163
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,960
not wanting to
volunteer these answers.

164
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,330
So that's where we were.

165
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,350
And we had this problem.

166
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,379
We really wanted the recitations
to be this really fun place,

167
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:19,170
where the students were
coming, and they're

168
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,450
wrestling with all
of these new ideas

169
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,340
and proposing these new things.

170
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,690
But we didn't have that.

171
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,660
We had this place where
students aren't coming prepared,

172
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,360
or if they're prepared, if we
can get a discussion going,

173
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,250
it's not the kind of
discussion we want.

174
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,550
It's sort of dominated
by one or two people.

175
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,880
So after some
thinking, I thought

176
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,560
active learning might
be a good approach

177
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,032
to solve both of these problems.

178
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:44,490
So, as I mentioned
earlier, there's

179
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,990
some evidence that
active learning

180
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,990
can be good for creating
an inclusive environment

181
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,130
in a classroom.

182
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,380
So for instance, one
common technique,

183
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,300
which I will talk
a bit about later,

184
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,370
is you pose a
question to the class,

185
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,060
but put everybody
in small groups,

186
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,200
have the students
discuss in small groups,

187
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,420
and then kind of bring the
classroom back together

188
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,640
for a wide discussion.

189
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,200
Students are in
their groups, they

190
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,711
get a chance to kind of vet
their ideas with their peers.

191
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:12,960
It's sort of hard if you're
in a group of two or three

192
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,090
to not participate.

193
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,354
You sort of have
to say something.

194
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:18,270
So they'll get to vet
their ideas with people,

195
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,490
they'll get some reassurance.

196
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,790
And in theory, they are then
more willing to bring that idea

197
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,050
back to the whole class.

198
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,360
That type of activity can also
give you a relatively easy way

199
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,480
to make sure one person doesn't
dominate the discussion,

200
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,210
by saying, OK, I split you
guys up into five groups,

201
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,143
and let's hear from
each group now.

202
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,330
Moreover, I thought if we
did a lot of active learning,

203
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,960
it might keep the students
engaged for longer.

204
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,572
It would help us
avoid lecturing.

205
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:48,030
It would help us
set this precedent

206
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,430
that you come to recitation
having read the paper,

207
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,415
we're not going to
lecture for you.

208
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:54,040
So that's kind of
where we're starting.

209
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,740
That's the baseline
for this talk.

210
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,610
Now my goal for all of you
is that this talk is, I hope,

211
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,290
exceedingly practical.

212
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,090
I'm going to talk about
some specific ways

213
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,370
that I trained my
staff to do this,

214
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,020
the types of active
learning activities

215
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,850
we do, some lessons
we've learned,

216
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,960
how we've evaluated our success.

217
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,590
I hope you'll be able to
apply some of these ideas

218
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,750
to your own classes if you want.

219
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,570
I do want to start,
though, with a disclaimer.

220
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,540
This is really a case study of
how active learning has worked

221
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,320
in 033.

222
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,310
I'm not here to make claims
that active learning is

223
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,470
a solution to all of
your teaching problems.

224
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,530
I think it's very good.

225
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,940
It's probably not the
solution to everything.

226
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,790
Nor am I even--

227
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,590
I'm not even here to
really evangelize it

228
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,061
over any other particular
pedagogical schemes.

229
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,560
I think it works well in 033,
I think we've done some really

230
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,642
cool things.

231
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:44,350
I hope you're excited
to hear about them.

232
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,610
So active learning.

233
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,590
As you've probably
picked up at this point,

234
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,620
what I'm going to talk about,
we're infusing the recitations

235
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,192
in 033 with active learning.

236
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:56,650
And so that means
that really it is

237
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,560
my recitation instructors
who are on the ground doing

238
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,610
a lot of this.

239
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,730
And I will admit, when
we were starting out,

240
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,590
I sort of thought--

241
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,550
I had this amazing idea to do
active learning recitations.

242
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,410
And I was like, well, I am done.

243
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,030
I have solved the problem.

244
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,160
I just told my instructors
to implement it.

245
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,100
It was like, guys,
active learning.

246
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,530
It didn't work.

247
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:25,150
I was perplexed, because I
told my instructors correctly

248
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,980
that these types
of activities would

249
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,780
help increase participation.

250
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,120
My instructors were the ones
complaining about the lack

251
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,110
of participation.

252
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,580
And so I just thought come
on, what's the problem.

253
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,600
Well it turns out you cannot
tell your instructors to do

254
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
a thing that they've never
done before and just have them

255
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,470
magically do it.

256
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,420
In particular, you can't
tell your instructors

257
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,940
to fundamentally change
the way they teach

258
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,040
and magically have that happen.

259
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,720
I would say it's
difficult enough

260
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,150
for us to change
the way we teach,

261
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,900
much less to get other people
to change the way they teach.

262
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,430
So the first part of
my talk is changing

263
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,130
the way other people
teach in four easy steps.

264
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,550
So step one is get
everyone on board.

265
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,110
So this is the first thing
that I did, last year in 033.

266
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,450
I will keep saying last
semester, but last year.

267
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,540
I presented active learning
as our primary goal

268
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,430
for the entire semester.

269
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,720
So we did not wait until
the course got settled down

270
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,840
to start doing it.

271
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,230
In fact, our very
first staff meeting,

272
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,350
which happens before the
semester has even begun,

273
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,090
was about active learning.

274
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,750
We had everyone on
the staff there.

275
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,500
So me, all of my
recitation instructors,

276
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,140
all of my TAs, all of the
communication instructors.

277
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,400
This is about 30
some people here.

278
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,380
And we talked about
active learning.

279
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,380
We talked about why it's a good
idea, the evidence that it's

280
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,440
a good idea, evidence that
it is better than lecturing.

281
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,830
We talked about why running the
recitations in this way would

282
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,190
support the other learning
objectives in 033,

283
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,490
in particular the objective
of getting students to design

284
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,704
their own systems and
evaluate their own tradeoffs.

285
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:05,620
I explained to my
instructors that there would

286
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,320
be extensive support for this.

287
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,140
And that we'd be checking
in throughout the semester

288
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,240
to make sure this was
really working for them

289
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,720
and working for the students.

290
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,980
Now I did expect some pushback
on this in this meeting.

291
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,210
Partly, I am asking a
lot of my staff here.

292
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,340
And also, I am a
lecturer in charge

293
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,350
of a lot of faculty, who have
been here for a very long time.

294
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,740
So I was not quite
sure how this would go.

295
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,660
I do not know if my
staff knew about this.

296
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,240
I actually went so far in
preparing for this staff

297
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,570
meeting to not only write
out all of my objectives

298
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,610
and why active learning
was a good idea,

299
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,780
but to write my own rebuttal
to myself and then rebut that.

300
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,350
So I sort of had, OK, if
I didn't want to do this,

301
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,935
I'd be asking--
well, I don't think

302
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:53,560
active learning is
a good idea, I don't

303
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,726
think this is going to work.

304
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:57,400
And I had prepared answers
for all of these questions.

305
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,160
I looked at the notes for that
meeting to prepare for this.

306
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,370
And it really went
on for quite a while.

307
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,820
I did not actually get
that much pushback here,

308
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,390
because my staff is amazing.

309
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,790
But also, I talked to a few of
my instructors ahead of time

310
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,280
about this, people who
had been with the class

311
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,150
for a while, who I knew would
be maybe a little bit more game

312
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,620
for this idea.

313
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,370
I kind of got them
on board first.

314
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,630
I also appealed to
everyone's scientific nature,

315
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,930
explaining that this was
somewhat of a research

316
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,570
project, which was true.

317
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,800
I did want to know
would this work in 033.

318
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,590
I was heavily biased
towards the fact

319
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,090
that I thought it
was going to work.

320
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,530
But we had methods to evaluate
this throughout the semester.

321
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,150
And I told them if
this goes horribly,

322
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,600
we won't keep doing it.

323
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,530
I'm not going to
burden you with this.

324
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,080
And I enthusiastically
mandated that this is what we

325
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,850
were trained for this semester.

326
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,100
In previous semesters,
I had suggested

327
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,230
some of these ideas,
encouraged my staff to try it.

328
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,570
And that really wasn't enough.

329
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,160
And so on the one hand,
get everyone on board.

330
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,480
It was one staff meeting.

331
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,130
I will say, it was
really tempting

332
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,370
for me to not have that
staff meeting so soon.

333
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,500
033 is such a big class.

334
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,112
It has so many people involved.

335
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:16,570
It feels like we're
just scrambling

336
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,330
to get the logistics worked
out in the first week or two.

337
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,520
Even for us assigning
our students to sections

338
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,890
is this whole thing.

339
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,490
But doing this really set the
tone for the whole semester.

340
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,759
I was kind of surprised
at how helpful this was.

341
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,800
Everybody knew the active
learning was important.

342
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,350
Even the people who weren't
the recitation instructors,

343
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,560
all the TAs, all the
communications instructors,

344
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,090
they knew that it
wasn't optional.

345
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,460
It was their primary
goal of the semester.

346
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,260
Any other changes that
we made in the class

347
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,770
were largely going to be
in support of this goal.

348
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,010
So step one, get everybody
on board with your mission.

349
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,170
Step two is do a lot of
work, do a lot of planning.

350
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,440
So step one was our
first staff meeting.

351
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,592
Step two, what's happening
in our second staff meeting.

352
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:03,050
So one of the things
that we did is

353
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:06,920
we talked about a pretty
well-known list of something

354
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,850
like 278 different active
learning activities.

355
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,060
I knew it was a
lot to ask really

356
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,090
anyone to read through all 278
active learning activities.

357
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,610
And so I annotated this list.

358
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,770
And we kind of
discussed the highlights

359
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,080
in the staff meeting.

360
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,110
I am going to go into detail in
the second part of this class

361
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,440
about some of the specific
activities we do in 033,

362
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,140
but I'll give you some
examples from this list just

363
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,577
for concreteness.

364
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:37,160
So one of them, which I really
like to do in lecture actually,

365
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,866
is--

366
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:38,990
they all have funny names--

367
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,000
OK, so fingers on chest.

368
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,537
So this is having students vote
on a multiple choice question,

369
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:46,120
but using like fingers
on their chest.

370
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,110
So option one, option
two, option three.

371
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,179
And that way, the
students can't see what

372
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:51,470
other people are voting really.

373
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,110
They're not quite like,
oh, everybody else

374
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,140
is voting for one.

375
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,701
They can't really see, so
they tend to be more truthful.

376
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:59,450
A lot of times in
lecture, I ask them just

377
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,824
do they feel good
about something

378
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:02,570
or bad about something.

379
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,470
Another one, a fairly common
one-- think, pair, share.

380
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,660
So posing a question
to the class,

381
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,910
asking students
to think about it,

382
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,210
then to share their
ideas with a partner.

383
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,630
And then maybe go and
address the larger class.

384
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,310
And then a third one,
which I like just

385
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,870
because it has a nice name--

386
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,140
the name for it
is human Tableau.

387
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,980
And so this is
having groups create

388
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,410
living scenes which
relate to the classroom

389
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,170
concepts or discussion.

390
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,060
So that one's a little
bit more out there.

391
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,170
But these are the
types of activities

392
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,702
we're thinking about.

393
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,410
And of course, we went
through this list.

394
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,118
We looked at a whole
bunch of activities.

395
00:16:38,118 --> 00:16:41,680
We're not going to end up
using all of them in 033.

396
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,570
But going through those list,
it was a really good exercise

397
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,740
for all of us.

398
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,450
It gave everyone a
much better sense

399
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,870
of what is active learning or
what can active learning be.

400
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,650
But even kind of
armed with that list,

401
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,470
it's still a lot to
tell your instructors,

402
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:02,910
here's your 278 activities,
now go, now do active learning.

403
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,780
So in addition to
this, I pre-planned

404
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,760
a lot of active
learning techniques

405
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,950
into each recitation.

406
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,990
So normally, before
active learning,

407
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,300
the way that I would
plan recitations

408
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,819
was strictly just for
technical content.

409
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,710
I would give my
instructors a handful

410
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,440
of major technical issues
they needed to hit on.

411
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,710
It helps keep our
recitations somewhat uniform

412
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,960
so that we can be fair on exams.

413
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,850
We do test the
technical material

414
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,570
on exams in this class.

415
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,150
Beyond that though,
my instructors

416
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,030
have a lot of leeway to
teach these topics however

417
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,880
they want, a lot of leeway
on how they teach in general.

418
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,620
I had never before
tried to steer them

419
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,820
in a particular direction.

420
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,380
But now, in addition to
that technical content,

421
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,990
what I would do is I would put
two or three active learning

422
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,470
activities or techniques
into each recitation.

423
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,930
So things like
pointing out places

424
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,030
where they could have
students break into groups

425
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,700
and think about a particular
question, pointing out

426
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,820
places where they could
hold a debate in the class.

427
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,400
And again, I'm going to talk
about these specific activities

428
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,965
we do in the second
part of this talk.

429
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:09,230
But planning
activities in this way

430
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,910
meant that my
instructors has had

431
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,130
a lot of ideas of
how they can make

432
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,020
this work in their sections.

433
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,665
Giving them multiple ideas and
multiple types of ideas really

434
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,540
meant that they could
pick the ones that they

435
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,040
were the most comfortable with.

436
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,290
So instead of saying, hey,
here's this really, really

437
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,290
out there idea, everybody
go try it, some of them

438
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,570
might try some of the
more extreme ones,

439
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,670
but everybody could
kind of find something

440
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,620
that they were comfortable with.

441
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,090
So get everybody on
board, plan things,

442
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,920
And the next thing that I
did was support my staff

443
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,550
as individuals.

444
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,310
So I didn't plan
these activities

445
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,960
and set the staff free.

446
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,220
I actually observed them
throughout the semester.

447
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,970
And I made sure
to stress that it

448
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,560
wasn't any sort of evaluation.

449
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,220
I was not there to
say, oh, boy, Karen,

450
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,694
this is really not working out.

451
00:18:57,694 --> 00:18:59,360
I was just there to
see what was working

452
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,430
and what wasn't, so
that we could all

453
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,710
iterate on these things.

454
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,350
In practice, this was great.

455
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,620
I, of course, found
way more good things

456
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,610
in doing this than
anything problematic.

457
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,190
Most of my feedback
to my instructors

458
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,170
was, hey, you did this
really awesome thing,

459
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,753
you should do more
of that, and can we

460
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:18,270
share it with everybody else.

461
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,435
And so, I really,
in the end kind

462
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:22,560
of thought of myself more
as a cheerleader for them

463
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,000
and what they were doing,
than someone who was coming in

464
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,310
are really critiquing anything.

465
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,190
I also got a lot of
great ideas from them,

466
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,812
both in how to present certain
technical content and twists

467
00:19:34,812 --> 00:19:36,520
on some of the active
learning techniques

468
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,320
that I had suggested.

469
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,160
So related to that, I'm
observing them as individuals,

470
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,160
but we would also
talk a lot as a group

471
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,870
about how this was going.

472
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,210
Every staff meeting
we'd take time

473
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,600
to talk about what went
well the previous week.

474
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,150
Our instructors would
share active learning ideas

475
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,920
that they tried, report
on how they went.

476
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,420
This was really nice.

477
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,410
It got some of my more
hesitant instructors kind

478
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,930
of on board with this,
to say like, oh, well,

479
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,210
that person tried it and it
seemed like it went really

480
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:07,710
well.

481
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,640
Maybe I'll try that next time.

482
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,950
And of course, the
thing that turned out

483
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,490
to be so great about this,
is that all of my instructors

484
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,700
have these amazing ideas on
how to teach certain things.

485
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,710
But to them, it
doesn't seem special,

486
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,130
like this is just always the way
I've taught operating systems.

487
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,410
And so, now we have this
space where we're getting

488
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,030
to share all of these ideas.

489
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,430
A lot of them relate to how
our active learning has gone.

490
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,070
But sometimes it's just,
hey, I taught this paper

491
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,120
this really cool way.

492
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,320
It has also-- the fact that
we've now kind of fostered

493
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,290
this space for discussion
at every staff meeting,

494
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,780
everybody is pretty
willing to bring up

495
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,850
things that aren't going as
well, to maybe come in and say,

496
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,030
hey, I tried this
active learning thing

497
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,994
and it did not work at all.

498
00:20:50,994 --> 00:20:51,910
What do you all think?

499
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,330
Is there something I could
have done differently?

500
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,360
Is this just not something
that will work for our class?

501
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,040
And so that has been
really, really great,

502
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,330
having this space for my staff
to kind of reflect on this

503
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,450
and not feel judged in any way.

504
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,250
So this is the first part of
getting active learning to work

505
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,550
in 033, which was a
lot of staff training.

506
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,830
But now the second part--

507
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,770
what do we actually do?

508
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,040
What are these activities?

509
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,160
I would like to give you some
specific examples from 033,

510
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,240
but I will also try to give you
some general feedback as well.

511
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,420
I realize you probably won't be
able to take the 033 activities

512
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,620
exactly into your classes,
so let me talk about some

513
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,550
of the common things that we do.

514
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,030
So these are things that
we've seen work really well

515
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,710
in our classes.

516
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,220
So one of the most common types
of active learning that we do

517
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,070
is one I have already
referenced a lot, which

518
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,810
is to put students in small
groups, have them do something,

519
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,030
and then bring them back
for a class-wide discussion.

520
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,600
So let me give you some
really specific examples.

521
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,110
We have a recitation where we
talk about content distribution

522
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,100
networks.

523
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,130
The paper they read
describes various goals

524
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,680
of those networks, so
performance, reliability,

525
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,920
scalability, things like this.

526
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,420
And what we'll do
in that recitation

527
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,300
is we'll divide the
class up into groups.

528
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,310
And we'll have each
group think about what

529
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,310
aspects of the system
support a particular goal.

530
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,120
So you think about performance,
you think about reliability,

531
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,880
you think about
scalability, et cetera.

532
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,430
And then we'll bring the
class back to a discussion

533
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,500
once they've thought
about that for a while.

534
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,920
Another example, when we talk
about naming in the Unix file

535
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,370
system, we start by asking
them, what things have names?

536
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,810
What things in Unix have names?

537
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,310
And again, we'll
put them in groups.

538
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,370
We'll try to get every group to
come up with as many things as

539
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,510
possible.

540
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,490
Because when we bring
them back together,

541
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,870
we'll try to get a different
thing from every group.

542
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,670
So you can't all
just say files, you

543
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,660
have to say like files, and
directories, and processes.

544
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,440
And there's a lot of things
in Unix that have names.

545
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,560
I'm not here to make
you Unix experts.

546
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,690
And so, in both of those
examples, like I said,

547
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,570
we'll bring the class back
together for a discussion.

548
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,020
We'll try to have each
group say something.

549
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,860
And as I said before, we've
seen very clearly, talking

550
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,990
in these small
groups before hand,

551
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,430
really makes the shyer
students a lot more confident.

552
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,610
And asking each group to
contribute to the discussion

553
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,520
means that we don't end up with
something that is dominated

554
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,160
by one or two groups.

555
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,130
Often, we'll even be a little
bit more relaxed about it.

556
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:40,150
We will just ask a big question,
some sort of thought question,

557
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:43,265
not just a tell me this
fact from the paper.

558
00:23:43,265 --> 00:23:45,050
We'll break them up
in the small groups,

559
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,050
have them think about it,
and come back together

560
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,570
for a discussion.

561
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,820
It's nice, it breaks
up the recitation.

562
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,240
It gets them kind of
talking and doing things.

563
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,500
We occasionally will have
our TAs teach in this class.

564
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,510
And we encourage them to use
these techniques as well.

565
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,600
And one of them asked me
a really good question

566
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,430
that I realized I had
never thought about.

567
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,800
She said, what do I do
when they're in groups?

568
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,070
Like, do I just stand
there and stare at them?

569
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,770
Probably not, that's
probably not good.

570
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,970
So to tell you what we do
while they're in groups,

571
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,446
sometimes our instructors
might actually check in

572
00:24:20,446 --> 00:24:21,820
with each group,
to say, oh, hey,

573
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,260
what are you guys
thinking about?

574
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,900
Sometimes, you're kind
of lightly monitoring,

575
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,210
you're walking around.

576
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,730
I know when I cover
recitations, sometimes

577
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,327
I use it as time to prep for
the thing that is coming next.

578
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:35,410
So if I need to draw
something on the board that's

579
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,550
going to take a minute,
I'll put you all in groups

580
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,880
so you can discuss
while I draw that.

581
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,330
So this works really
well as a technique

582
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,450
to get students
engaged and talking,

583
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,010
and honestly, it's also nice
from a classroom management

584
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:48,709
perspective.

585
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:51,250
It breaks things up, it gives
you a little break from talking

586
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,390
and you can drink some water.

587
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,546
So that is kind of
our starting point.

588
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:57,670
This is one thing where I
would say we do something

589
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:01,870
like this in almost every
single recitation, every Tuesday

590
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,250
and Thursday.

591
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,220
The second one is one
that I really like,

592
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,960
which is to have
the students debate.

593
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,160
It's a little bit harder
to work into a recitation.

594
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,010
You need a question
that can be debated.

595
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,280
For us, we have one
recitation where the students

596
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,230
read two short papers.

597
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,799
And the papers actually come
to opposing conclusions.

598
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,590
And so it's an interesting
lesson for them,

599
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,410
well, how could this
happen in science?

600
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:30,890
How could data say
two different things?

601
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,640
It is mind-blowing for them,
honestly, it's pretty wild.

602
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,790
And so we'll split
them into two teams.

603
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,280
And we'll give them each
a paper, have them debate.

604
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,130
The students usually
really like this.

605
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:48,290
They love to argue, so they're
very excited to do this.

606
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,580
It does involve a
bit more monitoring.

607
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,700
You want to make sure that
one team, or one person,

608
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,470
or one team doesn't dominate.

609
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:00,040
To combat that, we'll always
have the teams converse

610
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,350
beforehand, kind of get
your argument together

611
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,290
so you're ready to
prepare it for the class.

612
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,600
I personally think something
like that could also

613
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,140
work in small groups.

614
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,820
Maybe you have groups of
four, teams of two, debating.

615
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,060
I will say, when I've taught
this recitation, of these two

616
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,550
papers, there's like a
clear winner in my mind.

617
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,880
The last time I taught
this, the opposing team

618
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,400
made some very salient points.

619
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,730
So they really do
well with this.

620
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,370
So this one is one that
I think is really fun,

621
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,920
just a little bit more
difficult to work in

622
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,290
because of what it requires.

623
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,240
A third one, something
that we've actually

624
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,830
started doing more of this year,
is having them draw pictures.

625
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,850
So we'll ask them, in
groups, to draw pictures

626
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,210
on the board of whatever
system we're talking about,

627
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,790
or maybe some component
of that system.

628
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,350
And what we end up
with is a wide variety

629
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,700
of drawings of varying
levels of artistic skill.

630
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,290
And we can come
together and talk about,

631
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,180
what is each drawing showing?

632
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,850
What are the common
things that we're seeing

633
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,380
in all of these depictions?

634
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,270
What level of abstraction
is each drawing capturing?

635
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:12,490
That's something that comes
up a lot for us in 033.

636
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,280
I like this for a few reasons.

637
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,420
For 033 specifically, part of
our communication curriculum

638
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,620
involves teaching the students
how to design and draw figures.

639
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,610
So this, for us, this is just a
great way for them to practice.

640
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,970
It also forces them to figure
out exactly what the system is

641
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,000
doing.

642
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,880
And so we can expose
some areas where

643
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,320
they might have
missed something,

644
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,580
which always happens.

645
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,520
We expect them to read the
papers before they come in.

646
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,500
They should be able
to draw something.

647
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,570
It might not be perfect, and
that gives us a great space

648
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,540
to explore that, like
why was this confusing?

649
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,400
What is it about the paper
that made this confusing?

650
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,900
It's also just fun.

651
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,030
So the students get
a kick out of it.

652
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:59,535
Now the last activity that I
want to talk about, this is,

653
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:00,910
I'm going to say
that this is one

654
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,010
of our more extreme activities.

655
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,600
We actually do it
pretty frequently.

656
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,300
We will have students
act things out.

657
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,790
Also, the hardest
to make an icon for,

658
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,250
I just didn't know
what to do there.

659
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,880
They're acting, you can tell.

660
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,030
Now, I tell people about this
a lot, and whenever I say it,

661
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,670
like, oh, we act things
out in 033 all the time,

662
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,920
they are for sure intrigued.

663
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,050
They are not sure exactly
what that would entail.

664
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:30,470
So I was going to have
you all do this activity,

665
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,060
but we're half going
to do this activity.

666
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,220
So I kind of want to go
through one of our examples

667
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,640
actually in detail.

668
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,302
We have them act out a
system called MapReduce.

669
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,760
But for this to
make any sense, you

670
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,970
need to understand a little
bit about what MapReduce does.

671
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,340
So you're going to become--

672
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,280
I don't want to say
MapReduce experts,

673
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,230
MapReduce novices for
the next five minutes.

674
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:57,090
All right, so, brief aside
of technical material.

675
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,200
MapReduce is this
system for performing

676
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,330
parallel computation.

677
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,000
And so here's the
canonical example.

678
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,970
We have a large piece of text.

679
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,240
The Library of Congress
has a lot of books in it.

680
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,520
These books, we're
going to digitize this,

681
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,920
and so the data from
these books is spread out

682
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,590
on all different machines.

683
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,060
So we have a lot of computers.

684
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,160
Let's say, you all
can be computers.

685
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,910
So each one of you has a book
from the Library of Congress.

686
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,700
And here's the problem
that we want to solve,

687
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,410
the canonical MapReduce problem.

688
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,170
We want to count the
number of occurrences

689
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,952
of each word in
this entire corpus.

690
00:29:34,952 --> 00:29:36,910
So I want to know, how
many times does the word

691
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,240
apple appear?

692
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,480
How many times does
the word ball appear?

693
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,310
How many times does
the word the appear?

694
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,180
OK?

695
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,119
It's the canonical problem.

696
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,410
You all don't look like you
actually want to know that.

697
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,930
You do, you want to know
how many times the word

698
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,850
apple occurs in the
Library of Congress.

699
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:57,400
So you can imagine doing
that with one computer, where

700
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,370
that computer just reads
every book in sequence

701
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,760
and keeps track of these counts.

702
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,880
And that would be very slow.

703
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,880
So instead, what we
can do is we can have

704
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,250
multiple computers participate.

705
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,280
You all have a portion of
the Library of Congress.

706
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,180
You all can read your data.

707
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,090
You can make accounts
for your pieces of data.

708
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,630
This is the map phase.

709
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:23,980
And then we need some way to
kind of combine those results.

710
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,830
So if Dipa finds that the
word apple occurred five times

711
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,150
in her text, if Jesse found
that it occurred six times,

712
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,820
I need some way to add those up.

713
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,900
That would be the reduce phase.

714
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,960
And so part of the
insight of this system

715
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,930
is that there are a lot of
common problems in computer

716
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,576
science that can be
described this way.

717
00:30:40,576 --> 00:30:42,200
This is a system that
came from Google.

718
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,350
So Google is doing this
on your data all the time.

719
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,840
They are mapping and reducing
everything about you.

720
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,580
So let's see how that
would actually work,

721
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,320
how this system would work.

722
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,264
Jessie, come play your
role in this thing.

723
00:30:55,264 --> 00:30:56,680
JESSIE: Do I have
to wear the hat?

724
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,300
PROFESSOR: You do have to wear
the hat, it's active learning.

725
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,200
I've got to write master on it.

726
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,231
JESSIE: I'm ready.

727
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:08,980
PROFESSOR: I think a
lot of things in life

728
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,307
should be more fun.

729
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:12,640
So there's really no reason
for Jessie to wear this hat.

730
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,730
But there's also not a reason
for her not to wear this hat.

731
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,230
So--

732
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,172
JESSIE: There might be a reason.

733
00:31:18,172 --> 00:31:22,044
AUDIENCE: This is about
who this is fun for.

734
00:31:22,044 --> 00:31:24,779
JESSIE: Fortunately, I can't see
you, so now I feel comfortable.

735
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:27,070
PROFESSOR: Well, you can tilt
the hat back a little bit

736
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,760
maybe.

737
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,820
So in MapReduce, there
is the one machine

738
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,480
that acts as the coordination
for this, the master machine,

739
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,520
as Jessie is so--

740
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,960
doing such a great
job acting for us.

741
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,920
And so what the
master's job would be--

742
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,430
you don't have-- you're just--

743
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,900
we just want to visualize you.

744
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,790
You're just a prop, yes.

745
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,980
So it would start by
assigning jobs to workers.

746
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,400
Now you all, I didn't make hats
for all of you, there wasn't--

747
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,610
I know, I'm very sorry,
but you're all workers.

748
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,354
Only the master gets a hat.

749
00:31:56,354 --> 00:31:57,770
All right, so you
are all workers.

750
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:01,660
So one of the first things
Master Jessie would do,

751
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,470
would be to assign
map jobs to workers.

752
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,810
And she would tell you
things like exactly what data

753
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,740
to operate on.

754
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,830
So imagine a scenario where
you, a worker machine,

755
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,664
has data from a ton of
different corpuses on it.

756
00:32:15,664 --> 00:32:17,080
So Jessie actually
has to say, OK,

757
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,267
worry about the Library of
Congress part of your data.

758
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:21,850
And you would begin
operating on that.

759
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,245
You'd count your words.

760
00:32:24,245 --> 00:32:27,100
And you'd write out some
results to your disk,

761
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,359
that you also have
as a machine in this.

762
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:31,900
And then when you were done,
you would report back to Jessie.

763
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,626
And you'd tell her some various
meta information, kind of like,

764
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:37,000
these are the
words that I found.

765
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,840
You don't have to send
her all of your results,

766
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,464
because the Library of Congress
is big, you have a lot of data.

767
00:32:41,464 --> 00:32:45,280
But you might tell Jessie,
hey, I found apple.

768
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,340
Now, once all of you are
finished doing your map jobs,

769
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,090
Jessie has all of this
kind of meta information,

770
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,882
she can start assigning
the reduce jobs.

771
00:32:53,882 --> 00:32:55,840
And the reduce jobs are
a little bit different.

772
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,205
So Dipa if it was your job to
reduce, say, the word apple,

773
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:00,580
you need to know
a couple things.

774
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,705
You need to know, well,
which one of these machines

775
00:33:02,705 --> 00:33:04,360
actually found the word apple.

776
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,830
It's not necessarily
they're going

777
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,051
to be in every piece of data.

778
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,800
And Jessie would be
able to tell you that.

779
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,650
She'd basically say, hey,
Dipa contact these workers,

780
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,190
they have the data you need,
you can add them together,

781
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,140
in this example.

782
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,570
MapReduce functions can be
much more complex than this.

783
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,360
I thought let's start slow.

784
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,940
All right, so the reduce
workers would go, you'd reduce,

785
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,980
you'd report results
back to Jessie,

786
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,359
and then we'd have
our full counts.

787
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,650
I'm trying to decide how long
I want you to stand here,

788
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,900
and the answer is for
the rest of the talk,

789
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,540
but you can almost sit down.

790
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,290
All right, so this
is the basic--

791
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,300
JESSIE: I thought I'd
have more work to do.

792
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,008
PROFESSOR: I thought
that would be a lot.

793
00:33:42,008 --> 00:33:44,260
I didn't prep you for that.

794
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,190
Don't go yet, though.

795
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,140
JESSIE: I'm just moving over.

796
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,370
PROFESSOR: So this is the
basic idea of MapReduce.

797
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,380
This is the type of thing
we'd actually expect

798
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,850
the students to know coming in.

799
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,820
They've read the paper, and
they should understand this sort

800
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,680
of level of coordination.

801
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,680
But there are a lot of
details that we left out.

802
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,440
For instance, I didn't
ask you all, hey, what

803
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,880
happens if a machine fails?

804
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,460
Worker Dipa crashes,
what do we do?

805
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,659
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

806
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,310
PROFESSOR: All the time, right?

807
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,560
Is that data that she
was storing, is it

808
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,120
anywhere else in the system?

809
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,110
How do we know?

810
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,600
What if she had half
finished the job?

811
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,659
What do we do?

812
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,110
Or even, what if there was
no crash, but like let's say

813
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:25,900
the worker Janet is just running
really slow, like she's going,

814
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:30,320
she's working hard, but
everyone else is finished

815
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,480
and we're just waiting on Janet.

816
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,399
And these are those
types of things.

817
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,440
Those are the interesting
things about MapReduce.

818
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,080
That's the point where there
are tradeoffs for the students

819
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,706
to think about.

820
00:34:39,706 --> 00:34:41,455
So it's not just
important to think about,

821
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:44,090
oh gosh, what does happen if
a machine crashes or is slow,

822
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,440
but why does it happen that way.

823
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:52,040
So to do this, we actually
have them act out this system.

824
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,929
And from the way that
I've described it here,

825
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:56,330
you might think, well, I have
one student be the master

826
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,100
and everybody else
is a worker, that's

827
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,740
kind of what I was
setting you all up for.

828
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,200
This is not actually
how we do it.

829
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,650
Normally-- for one, it
doesn't work with the size

830
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,860
of our recitations.

831
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,600
Even here, this is a lot
of workers for one student

832
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,820
to be in charge of.

833
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,010
And also, if Jessie was
maybe more of a shy student,

834
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,000
she's like this is the
worst day of my entire life.

835
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,090
Katrina has made me wear a
hat, and I have to stand--

836
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:26,190
I am in charge of
everything, it's not good.

837
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,140
It's not good.

838
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,072
So in practice, here's
how we do this activity.

839
00:35:31,072 --> 00:35:32,280
You can sit down if you want.

840
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,310
You don't have to
be here anymore.

841
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,685
JESSIE: Should I
keep the hat on?

842
00:35:34,685 --> 00:35:36,560
PROFESSOR: I think,
definitely, yes.

843
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,020
I think absolutely.

844
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,990
So we do start by
assigning students roles.

845
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,100
But we will usually
have them in teams.

846
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,220
So there will be a master team.

847
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,670
Each worker will be a team of
maybe two or three students.

848
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,950
This is good for
a lot of reasons.

849
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,120
Again, for the reason of
getting the shyer students

850
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,840
to be a little bit
more comfortable,

851
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,010
no one student is in
charge of something.

852
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:04,220
From a logistical
standpoint, again, I

853
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,980
glazed over many a
detail in MapReduce,

854
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,920
but you can imagine that
the master has a lot to do,

855
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,480
a lot to keep track of.

856
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,870
And so we will often,
we'll have our master team.

857
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,940
And we'll actually give each
student in that team a task.

858
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,130
So one might run the
clock, timing in the system

859
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:22,890
is important.

860
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,920
We'll see an example
of that in a second.

861
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,250
One keeps track of what
map tasks to complete.

862
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,400
One assigns the tasks,
things like that.

863
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,920
We have found-- we've
actually done this activity

864
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,270
a number of times.

865
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,900
It gets better every time.

866
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,710
One of the things we
learned the most quickly

867
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,240
is that the master--
we had to give

868
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
the students who were
doing the master extremely

869
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,510
detailed instructions.

870
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,020
If we just said do
the master's job,

871
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,920
they were not ready for that.

872
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,230
In some sections, in fact,
some of my instructors

873
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,290
prefer to do this where the
instructor just is the master,

874
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,170
and so they can be kind of
in charge of coordination.

875
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,200
Workers in this example get a
little bit of an easier job.

876
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,810
Again, we're putting them
in teams of two to three.

877
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,050
Sometimes we might give them
a sheet with words on it,

878
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,810
and actually ask them
to count the words.

879
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,050
Sometimes we'll give them
a sheet that kind of just

880
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:15,290
says here's the words in your
data and here are the counts.

881
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:18,560
That might seem like, oh,
gosh what's the point,

882
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,930
they're not actually
doing the worker job.

883
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,650
Counting the words in the text
is not the interesting part

884
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,740
of this system.

885
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,500
So sometimes we'll
just skip that.

886
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,860
It also, again, lets us do
some very precise things

887
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,300
with timing.

888
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,220
So once these
roles are assigned,

889
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,410
we're going to run the protocol.

890
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,260
So the person keeping
track of the master clock

891
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,920
will advance it, one click,
two clicks, et cetera.

892
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,680
Various map jobs will complete.

893
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,930
Most of the time, when we
give them a paper that says,

894
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,390
here's your words and your
counts, we'll also say,

895
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,610
hey, it takes three clock
cycles for you to complete.

896
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,300
And so once the clock
has ticked three times,

897
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,300
they'll report back
to the master team.

898
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,120
Because of how we set up
those map tasks, some of them

899
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,350
will also fail.

900
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:06,320
Some of them will have
papers that say, oh, I

901
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,460
failed after click two.

902
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,740
And they have to
announce it to the class.

903
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,660
And at that point, we pause.

904
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,260
What happens?

905
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,870
What happens when
a machine fails?

906
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,470
What does MapReduce do?

907
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,836
Why does it do that?

908
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:21,420
The spoiler for you all
in MapReduce, the master

909
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,300
will reassign that
task to somewhere else.

910
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,370
And part of that
challenge is making sure

911
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,070
that the new worker has
access to the data that

912
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,630
was on the crashed machine.

913
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,262
MapReduce replicates data, so
we talk about how that happens.

914
00:38:33,262 --> 00:38:35,240
And the protocol continues.

915
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,630
The students will find that one
map task, it hasn't crashed,

916
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,950
but it's taking
a very long time.

917
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,130
And that's another good
point for discussion.

918
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,600
What does MapReduce do?

919
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,370
Does it just wait?

920
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:49,490
In practice, it restarts
the task in another machine.

921
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,950
And then, so, oh, there's a
question, these two machines

922
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,930
are running the same thing.

923
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:54,597
What do we do?

924
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:55,430
Who do we listen to?

925
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,110
How do we get the data?

926
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:01,280
And this is why the timing of
that activity is so important,

927
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,740
because a lot of the discussion
points about MapReduce

928
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:08,150
come from what we do when things
are slow or when things fail.

929
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:11,640
So being in control of
that timing is crucial.

930
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,780
We do have some variations
on this activity though.

931
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,050
One of our instructors this year
had students count characters

932
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,150
instead of words, same idea.

933
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:24,860
But of the workers was
counting Russian characters

934
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,850
instead of English.

935
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,490
So they just organically were
much slower than the rest

936
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,570
of the class.

937
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,570
And that was kind of a
nice way to show that.

938
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,030
Many of our instructors
have the students

939
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,490
count types of candy
instead of words.

940
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,770
And we bring them candy.

941
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,850
That's a big hit.

942
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,270
In fact, after we did
this recitation this year,

943
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:47,120
one of our students asked
why can't every recitation

944
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,770
be like the MapReduce one.

945
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:51,260
It is not clear
how much the candy

946
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,990
factored into that question.

947
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,820
So it has taken us
quite a few iterations

948
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,640
to get that activity working.

949
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,530
And again, I know
you're not all teaching

950
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,760
MapReduce in your courses.

951
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,010
You're not going to take
that activity to you.

952
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,910
But the things that
were interesting for us,

953
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,950
having the students in teams
for each of these roles

954
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,590
made a huge difference,
both in terms

955
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,252
of making sure they were all
doing the correct things,

956
00:40:15,252 --> 00:40:17,210
but just getting them
more comfortable with it.

957
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,370
I will tell you, the
students go for this.

958
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,450
They are into it.

959
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,890
They map and reduce.

960
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:26,210
They do not think it's stupid,
which is very, very nice.

961
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:30,080
And making sure that the master
has these exceedingly detailed

962
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,410
instructions, figuring out
how to make the timing work,

963
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,780
so that all of the things
we wanted to discuss

964
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,132
would actually happen.

965
00:40:38,132 --> 00:40:40,340
And so really the activity
is the way I describe it--

966
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,710
Karen, this is
how Karen does it.

967
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,170
Karen, you're the authoritative
source on how we do MapReduce--

968
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,210
yeah.

969
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,300
I want to talk briefly about
another system we act out

970
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,101
because it's fun.

971
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:52,850
It's one of my favorite
things that we do.

972
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,870
It's much shorter.

973
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:56,240
We do this for a
system called Raft.

974
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,480
And Raft, like MapReduce is
this large distributed system

975
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,100
on a lot of machines.

976
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,390
Timing is also
important in Raft.

977
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,350
In particular, machines
set randomized timers.

978
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,830
I picked some random number
of seconds, milliseconds,

979
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,290
whatever.

980
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,820
And when that timer
expires, they do something.

981
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,990
So being able to act that out
is actually really crucial.

982
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,801
And we thought, gosh, how are
we going to randomize them?

983
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:23,300
And so one of my
instructors came up

984
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,960
with the best idea, which is to
have the students spin around

985
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,770
in a circle.

986
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:30,470
So like literally,
they're standing here,

987
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:35,600
and then they kind of-- they
do this, and it takes a while.

988
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,970
Because he figured
out that students

989
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,220
just walk around naturally
at different paces.

990
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,240
So they've effectively
randomized themselves.

991
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,750
Someone will finish first.

992
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,385
So I need you to imagine feel
like you're walking around MIT,

993
00:41:47,385 --> 00:41:48,760
and you're just
kind of like, oh,

994
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,010
what's going on in this class.

995
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,190
And you see seven
or eight students up

996
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,980
at the front of the room just
very quietly spinning around

997
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,500
in place, while all of the
other students are like--

998
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,990
the person who
finishes first wins.

999
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:03,200
And so who-- who is it?

1000
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,170
Who's going to be the next
leader of this election

1001
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,950
cycle in Raft.

1002
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,350
It's really-- it
looks ridiculous,

1003
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,320
but it works so well.

1004
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,370
And it brings me a lot of joy.

1005
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,130
So to kind of wrap
up our activities

1006
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,995
before I get to results,
effectively, how

1007
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,510
has this worked for us--

1008
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,820
again, we do all of
these things a lot.

1009
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,040
This one in particular,
small groups,

1010
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,660
a class wide discussion--

1011
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,180
although acting things out, we
act a lot of things out now.

1012
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,870
We've gotten pretty
good at that.

1013
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,020
And the key component for
us has been recognizing

1014
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,300
in all of these
cases, the students

1015
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,940
are more comfortable if they're
not doing something alone,

1016
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,700
if they have at least one other
person on their team doing

1017
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,550
whatever it is they need
to do in that recitation.

1018
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,980
And since we do something
like this in every recitation,

1019
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,470
the students just
come to expect it.

1020
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,660
I mean, they go for it.

1021
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,610
Sometimes, I'll come in
and cover a recitation.

1022
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:58,070
And despite
observations, I'm never

1023
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,016
exactly sure how my
instructors are leaving things.

1024
00:43:01,016 --> 00:43:02,390
And so, I always
start by asking,

1025
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,970
like, hey, I'm going to
put you all in groups,

1026
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,890
is that something
you're used to.

1027
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,140
Every time, they're
like, yeah, we

1028
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,720
do that every day, like of
course we can get into groups.

1029
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,650
So again, even acting things
out, they really go for it.

1030
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,260
We try to vary the
types of activities

1031
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,480
that we do each week, to
keep everyone engaged,

1032
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,100
to keep things interesting.

1033
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,050
It's hard to act
ever system out.

1034
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,360
And there's occasions where
an activity doesn't work.

1035
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,960
The first time we tried
MapReduce, it was chaos.

1036
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,917
But we thought it
was a cool thing.

1037
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:35,750
So we just iterated.

1038
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,940
We just tried it again
the next semester.

1039
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,280
And in planning
all of these, we're

1040
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,390
still very careful to make sure
that our activities actually

1041
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,460
teach them things.

1042
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,680
Like I said, all
of the recitations

1043
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,550
have technical points
that they have to hit on.

1044
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,840
A MapReduce activity
where they just

1045
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,950
act out the system in its normal
use case, it would be fun,

1046
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,840
but they're supposed to
come in knowing that.

1047
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,650
So we really want to
design these activities

1048
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,940
so that we're hitting on the
points we need to hit on.

1049
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,800
So there is a lot of
planning that goes into this.

1050
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,700
So now, for the final
part, did it work?

1051
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,520
What got better?

1052
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,640
I'll start with a few
actually quantitative things.

1053
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,910
Sometimes when I tell
people about this endeavor,

1054
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,720
they want to know,
are grades better?

1055
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,270
Have the students'
grades improved?

1056
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,320
How are they doing on exams?

1057
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,730
I don't personally think that
that's the right question.

1058
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,790
There is one aspect of
grading that has improved--

1059
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,290
participation grades.

1060
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,740
We assign a pretty large
portion of the final grade

1061
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,630
to participation in recitation.

1062
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,340
Again, we're asking
a lot of them.

1063
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,450
We're expecting them to
demonstrate certain skills

1064
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,930
in recitation, so they
are graded accordingly.

1065
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,540
And we're seeing students earn
higher participation grades

1066
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,260
now.

1067
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,480
I'm comfortable
interpreting that as they

1068
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,070
are participating more.

1069
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:56,140
We are also giving them
a lot more opportunities

1070
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,580
to participate.

1071
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,267
Related to that,
one of the things

1072
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:00,850
that we've gained
from this experience

1073
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:03,880
is just a better
understanding of what it means

1074
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,490
to participate in our class.

1075
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,890
For a long time
to us, it kind of

1076
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,320
meant, well, does this
student answer questions

1077
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,240
when I ask them a question.

1078
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,789
But now it means, are they
coming prepared to class?

1079
00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:17,080
Are they engaged in group work?

1080
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,580
Are they listening
to other students

1081
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,750
and to their instructor?

1082
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,250
Are they participating in
class wide discussions?

1083
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,450
There is more opportunities
for students to participate.

1084
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:29,030
We are much clearer about
how we assign this grade.

1085
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,940
So not only have
the grades improved,

1086
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:35,760
but the students are noticeably
more relaxed about this grade.

1087
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,690
I get fewer complaints
about this grade,

1088
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,130
which is great for me.

1089
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,530
And they know that if they
come prepared and ready to do

1090
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,007
the work, they'll be fine.

1091
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,590
AUDIENCE: The grade
for the recitation

1092
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,850
is separate from
the course grade?

1093
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:50,800
PROFESSOR: It's part of the
final grade in the course.

1094
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,020
A percentage of the final
grade is from participation

1095
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,430
in recitation.

1096
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:59,620
So we also surveyed the
students during the semester.

1097
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,720
And we were largely
asking questions about

1098
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,530
do you feel comfortable
in the recitations.

1099
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,380
Largely, yes, they did.

1100
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,660
In our final survey,
overwhelmingly the students

1101
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,120
felt that these activities
improved their engagement.

1102
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,724
So these things are all good.

1103
00:46:16,724 --> 00:46:18,140
I don't think they
really captured

1104
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,960
though what has been so
great about this endeavor

1105
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,350
for our class.

1106
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:25,160
And so in preparing
this talk, I spoke

1107
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,050
to a couple of
instructors who have been

1108
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,710
with me for a number of years.

1109
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,910
So they've seen the class
through its non-active learning

1110
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:36,620
era, through the dark times,
as well as the current era.

1111
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,470
And so I stole a few quotes
from them to kind of sum

1112
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:41,840
up what I think is made
this approach better

1113
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,230
for the students.

1114
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,540
So let's turn to number one.

1115
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,120
The first is that I think the
students actually understand

1116
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,650
the algorithms better.

1117
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,930
In particular, if we're
acting something out,

1118
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:53,270
it gives them a visceral
experience of the finer points

1119
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,800
and edge conditions.

1120
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,660
It's really easy to
slide over things

1121
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,460
if one reads a paper
quickly, and we're

1122
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,900
asking them to read a lot.

1123
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,720
Second instructor, I think
that it's much better when

1124
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,550
there are pairs
discussing a solution

1125
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,290
or when we're doing a game.

1126
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:10,020
People are more likely to notice
a flaw in something I've said

1127
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,490
or in someone else's answer.

1128
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,500
And they ask better questions.

1129
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,270
Plus, I think it's
reassuring either

1130
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:17,970
to find out that a classmate
is just as confused

1131
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:21,021
or to find out that a classmate
knows a ton about the subject.

1132
00:47:21,021 --> 00:47:22,520
And then the last
one, which I think

1133
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,520
really sums up how things
have been for our students,

1134
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,590
is this one.

1135
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:29,090
I think the students are more
engaged because they are asked

1136
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:31,040
to be more active participants.

1137
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,350
There's a greater sense of
camaraderie between them

1138
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,790
because of their interactions.

1139
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:37,880
So we're seeing these
students understanding

1140
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,370
the details of the systems
better, while developing

1141
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:41,930
this sense of camaraderie.

1142
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:44,690
And honestly, that
has been huge for us.

1143
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,940
Largely, I would say,
from my perspective

1144
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,770
as the person in
charge, students

1145
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:52,280
are buying into this class
more than they used to.

1146
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,250
I get fewer complaints
across the board.

1147
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,620
We're seeing them
work better together

1148
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,430
in their team projects.

1149
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,190
We're seeing them
be more engaged

1150
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:04,820
in lecture and in tutorial, even
though recitations was really

1151
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,672
where this active
learning push happened.

1152
00:48:07,672 --> 00:48:09,380
And this whole thing
has been beneficial,

1153
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:14,277
not just for the students,
but also for the staff.

1154
00:48:14,277 --> 00:48:15,860
There was a little
hesitance at first.

1155
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,090
Active learning
can be a hard sell.

1156
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:20,510
It involves more
work for everyone.

1157
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,050
It takes a lot of planning.

1158
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:24,410
It can be a nerve-wracking
way to teach if you've never

1159
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:25,390
taught it before.

1160
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,380
Imagine coming into
a room of students

1161
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,032
you don't know very well,
and say, OK, five of your

1162
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,490
are going to be on
the master team,

1163
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:34,010
let's go, I made
you all hats, right?

1164
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:38,670
But now, one of my
instructors said,

1165
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,490
there's a modest
amount of competition

1166
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:44,180
among the recitation instructors
to work out schemes and games.

1167
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,420
So it feels like there's both
a reward for applying myself,

1168
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,204
but there's also less
need for perfection.

1169
00:48:50,204 --> 00:48:51,620
It's helped that
we're encouraging

1170
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,930
active learning is an
approach, because it makes

1171
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,580
it feel like less
of a risk for me

1172
00:48:55,580 --> 00:49:00,020
to try some new unconventional
approach that occurs to me.

1173
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,020
So I'll tell you one of
the highlights for me,

1174
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,600
as a person sort of
overseeing this operation.

1175
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,182
So this happened at the
end of last semester.

1176
00:49:08,182 --> 00:49:09,890
Again, that's the
first time we're really

1177
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:11,634
putting this scheme into place.

1178
00:49:11,634 --> 00:49:13,050
And near the end,
my instructors--

1179
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,810
I got this email
from the instructors

1180
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:17,139
about one of the
final recitations.

1181
00:49:17,139 --> 00:49:18,680
And the recitation
was about a system

1182
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,740
called DNS SEC, secure DNS.

1183
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,240
So it deals with security.

1184
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,210
DNS prevents certain types of
attacks on a system called DNS.

1185
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,910
That's all you need
to know DNS SEC.

1186
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:31,080
So the first instructor
described an activity

1187
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,310
they had done, where they
had groups draw diagrams

1188
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,729
of their attacks on
the board in parallel

1189
00:49:36,729 --> 00:49:38,270
and then talked
through each diagram,

1190
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,680
with the students explaining
the problems and the approaches.

1191
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,330
And the instructor
noted that they engaged,

1192
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:47,330
they laughed, they collaborated,
they learned more about

1193
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,480
how design figures to tell
the story they wanted to tell.

1194
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,700
And I got this email,
and I was so excited.

1195
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,280
Because this was not an activity
that I had planned for them.

1196
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,120
This is just something
they had done.

1197
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,320
And I thought, it's happened,
finally it's happened.

1198
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,910
And then I get a second email.

1199
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:03,890
And so a second
instructor responded

1200
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:05,600
saying that that sounded great.

1201
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,030
And what they had done,
they'd had a group of students

1202
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:11,270
work out how DNS would work
for a particular scenario, so

1203
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:13,040
the original system.

1204
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,950
And then two additional groups
joined that first group,

1205
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:18,320
worked through how
different attacks would

1206
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,980
affect that scenario.

1207
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,460
And then a fourth
group acted as DNS SEC,

1208
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,770
and explain how DNS SEC
would prevent such attacks.

1209
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,930
So to brand new ideas,
both really good,

1210
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:30,050
both really different.

1211
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,460
And this is so exciting.

1212
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,560
And then we get to
instructor number three.

1213
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,180
And I've never been
able to figure out

1214
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,160
a way to summarize this email.

1215
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,950
So I have to quote
it for you directly.

1216
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,320
"In my recitation, we
had a marriage proposal

1217
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,290
that went bad when a romantic
rival launched an attack

1218
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,910
to destroy the relationship.

1219
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,710
A second group used
a different attack

1220
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:52,070
to induce peasants to send
their taxes to a scammer.

1221
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:53,840
All of these attacks
were then prevented

1222
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,850
by the use of DNS SEC.

1223
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:59,540
After each play, we did a replay
with deep structure analysis

1224
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:03,080
that made the analogy between
the play and DNS explicit.

1225
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,360
Overall, a pretty
fun recitation and I

1226
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,760
was impressed with the
creativity, enthusiasm,

1227
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,430
and acting talent the
students displayed."

1228
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:12,507
So this was amazing.

1229
00:51:12,507 --> 00:51:14,090
This was like such--
this email thread

1230
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:15,590
is just such a triumph for me.

1231
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:18,770
I have it highlighted
and saved in my email.

1232
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,350
And this has continued
on since last semester.

1233
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,330
I get like one of these
email threads a week

1234
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,540
now, with my instructor telling
me all of the cool things

1235
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,250
that they have done.

1236
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:32,390
So the last thing, which I hope
has come through in this talk,

1237
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:36,020
it was a lot of work to
get this to happen in 033.

1238
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,500
I cannot in good faith stand
here tell you active learning

1239
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,390
is a breeze, you can just add
it in, five minutes of prep time

1240
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,340
before the class.

1241
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,375
It's a lot of work.

1242
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:47,810
But this class is
so much fun now.

1243
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,610
It's fun for me to run.

1244
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,149
It's fun for
instructors to teach.

1245
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,940
I don't know how many
people would tell you

1246
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:56,350
that their 400-person
class is fun to run.

1247
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,910
But I have a great time.

1248
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:01,340
And the amount of enjoyment that
we get out of teaching 033 this

1249
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,160
way really comes through
for the students.

1250
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,250
And I think that's another
component of what has helped

1251
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,990
them engage more in this class.

1252
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,790
So it has worked
really well for us.

1253
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:14,150
I hope that you get some
practical things that you can

1254
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:15,750
try out in your own classes.

1255
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:19,310
And I'm happy to take questions
or to delegate questions off

1256
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:21,820
to Jesse and Karen.
