00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.060
PROFESSOR: So I am
going to start this talk

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.340
by explaining the title.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.620
So we'll start with
active learning.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.420
What is active learning?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.180
In my mind, it's this
pretty broad term.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.000
It's a form of learning that
attempts to involve students

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.916
more directly in the
learning process.

00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:41.290
And there are all
sorts of things

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.780
that fall under the
umbrella of active learning.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.790
So things like having
students engage in group

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.540
work, in class-wide
discussions, in debates,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.690
acting out certain concepts,
group problem solving

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.580
sessions, all of these things.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.200
And so in all of
those activities,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.180
students are engaged.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.610
They're not passively
listening to a lecture,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.050
they're actively participating.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.060
And there is some evidence
that this style of learning

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.350
is good for a lot of things.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.630
There is evidence to support
the effectiveness of student

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.740
engagement in exam
scores, failure rates, how

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.220
well students remember content,
student attitudes, study

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.430
habits.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.970
And there's also evidence
that active learning

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.090
has a disproportionate benefit
for minorities, students

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.330
from disadvantaged
backgrounds, female students,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.430
and male dominated fields.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.970
So there's evidence that active
learning creates this more

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.230
inclusive environment.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.660
So it's this wide, wide
variety of techniques reported

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.390
to have a lot of benefits.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.230
So that's active learning.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.240
Now, what is 6.033?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.820
So 6.033 is computer
systems engineering.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.510
It's a required class
for all computer science

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.870
majors, which means as a
result, at MIT it's quite large.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.620
So like Dipa said, we
have about 400 students.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.850
It runs once a year.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.180
So every spring we
get 400 new students.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.850
Most of them are
juniors and seniors.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.050
And in some ways, 033
is a typical MIT class.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.800
We have lectures twice a week.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.860
We have recitations
twice a week.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.290
But in most other ways, 033
is not a typical MIT class.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.840
For one, it's a CIM class.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.470
So it's a Communications
Intensive in the Major class.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.630
That means that most
of our assignments

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.110
are based around writing
or oral presentations.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.840
It's not a class where students
are implementing or building

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.490
a lot of things.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.000
We focus heavily on
reading and on writing.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.690
In particular, we have
tutorial sections each week,

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.810
dedicated to the
communication material,

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.020
taught by dedicated
communication staff.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.160
The major assignment in
033 is a design project.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.690
It takes most of the semester.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.380
The students completed in
teams, usually teams of three.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.470
And it's comprised of a
few written assignments

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.450
and oral presentations.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.500
One of our big focuses for that
project is getting students

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.770
to recognize the trade-offs
they need to make when they're

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.140
designing a system,
and getting them

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.730
to defend those trade-offs.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.140
So this is not
just a class about

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.410
how computer systems work,
but how we design them,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.930
how we decide what
choices to make when

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.970
we're building those systems.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.280
So the last thing that
makes 033 pretty unique,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.800
and is what I'm largely
going to talk about here,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.770
is that our recitation
sections are pretty intense.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.250
They are taught by faculty,
senior research staff.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.980
We have about 25
students per section.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.380
So you are right to think
that, oh, my gosh, they have

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.720
like 18 sections per semester.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.540
We do.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.970
It's a lot.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.690
Each recitation focuses
around a technical paper

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.240
that the students
have read beforehand.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.190
And the goal for those
discussion sections,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.030
those recitations, is for them
to be largely discussion based.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.550
And in fact, that has
always been the goal of 033.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.470
033 has been around for
almost 50 years at this point.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.480
It's been around since
before I was born.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.270
And the goal has always
been for these recitations

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.100
to be discussion based.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.649
During the recitations,
we're talking about,

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.709
we talk about the system
that the paper describes--

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.920
does it work?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.920
What were the trade-offs
that the authors made?

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.160
Do we like this system?

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.900
How would you
design this system?

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.840
All right, so that is 033.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.800
Now, why put active
learning into 033?

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.370
And you might think that it's
just because, well, there's

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.910
evidence that active
learning can be a good idea,

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.160
so why not try it?

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.250
That's fair.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.260
We were actually trying to
solve a pretty specific problem

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.960
in the class though.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.180
So like I said,
ideally the recitations

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.670
are based heavily
around discussion.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.100
And again, that has
always been the goal.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.910
Because this is a class about
system design, not just about

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.460
how these systems work,
one way that we teach

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.480
that is by having the
students analyze and critique

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.280
existing systems
before they go out

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.910
and try to design their own.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.570
And so, what are the
goals of the designers?

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.640
Does the system
meet those goals?

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.290
Are those goals important?

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.119
If you were redesigning the
system, how would you do it?

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:23.160
What would your goals be?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.784
What trade-offs would
you have to make?

00:05:24.784 --> 00:05:26.130
Things like that.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.350
A large part of that
instruction happens

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.910
in the recitation, where we're
having these discussions.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.430
And they go and
apply those skills

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.350
to their design projects.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.070
So to get that to happen, it's
important that the students are

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.290
engaged in recitation,
that they're

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.810
reading the paper beforehand,
they're asking questions,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.018
they're answering questions,
they're coming prepared,

00:05:45.018 --> 00:05:46.082
things like that.

00:05:46.082 --> 00:05:48.690
And for a long time, that
was not happening for us.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.000
We had a lot of
trouble with this.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.230
We found that students weren't
willing to volunteer answers.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.540
When we'd ask them a question,
nobody would raise their hand.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.960
We found that some of
them weren't even reading

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.370
the paper beforehand.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.280
So they're just kind
of coming in confused.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.410
As a result of all of
this, our instructors

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.140
would end up spending
the first 15, 20, 25

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.710
minutes of the recitation
lecturing about the paper,

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.070
because so many of the
students didn't come prepared.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.680
And then that just made things
worse, as you can imagine.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.381
Students know that they're
going to come into recitation,

00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:23.880
that they're going
to get a lecture,

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.490
so why bother reading the paper,
if your instructor is just

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.615
going to explain it to you.

00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:30.330
And so it was just kind
of making things worse.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.570
We weren't getting to teach
the material that we really

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.700
needed to teach, because
we were spending time

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.470
rehashing these papers.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.350
The students
weren't learning how

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.100
to read these papers,
how to analyze them,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.360
how to critique them.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.590
And honestly, it
wasn't much fun.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.960
It wasn't all that much
fun to teach this way.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.820
Occasionally, we could get a
discussion going in a class.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.210
But we would then encounter
another problem, which

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.480
is pretty common, where
we'd have a discussion,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.680
but it would be dominated
by two or three students

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.260
in the room, the same
two or three students.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.540
And then other students
are tuning out,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.020
or even becoming sort of
visibly uncomfortable,

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.960
not wanting to
volunteer these answers.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.330
So that's where we were.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.350
And we had this problem.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.379
We really wanted the recitations
to be this really fun place,

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:19.170
where the students were
coming, and they're

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.450
wrestling with all
of these new ideas

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.340
and proposing these new things.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.690
But we didn't have that.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.660
We had this place where
students aren't coming prepared,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.360
or if they're prepared, if we
can get a discussion going,

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.250
it's not the kind of
discussion we want.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.550
It's sort of dominated
by one or two people.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.880
So after some
thinking, I thought

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.560
active learning might
be a good approach

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.032
to solve both of these problems.

00:07:43.032 --> 00:07:44.490
So, as I mentioned
earlier, there's

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.990
some evidence that
active learning

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.990
can be good for creating
an inclusive environment

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.130
in a classroom.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.380
So for instance, one
common technique,

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.300
which I will talk
a bit about later,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.370
is you pose a
question to the class,

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.060
but put everybody
in small groups,

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.200
have the students
discuss in small groups,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.420
and then kind of bring the
classroom back together

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.640
for a wide discussion.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.200
Students are in
their groups, they

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.711
get a chance to kind of vet
their ideas with their peers.

00:08:10.711 --> 00:08:12.960
It's sort of hard if you're
in a group of two or three

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.090
to not participate.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.354
You sort of have
to say something.

00:08:16.354 --> 00:08:18.270
So they'll get to vet
their ideas with people,

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.490
they'll get some reassurance.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.790
And in theory, they are then
more willing to bring that idea

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.050
back to the whole class.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.360
That type of activity can also
give you a relatively easy way

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.480
to make sure one person doesn't
dominate the discussion,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.210
by saying, OK, I split you
guys up into five groups,

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.143
and let's hear from
each group now.

00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:42.330
Moreover, I thought if we
did a lot of active learning,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.960
it might keep the students
engaged for longer.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.572
It would help us
avoid lecturing.

00:08:46.572 --> 00:08:48.030
It would help us
set this precedent

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.430
that you come to recitation
having read the paper,

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.415
we're not going to
lecture for you.

00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:54.040
So that's kind of
where we're starting.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.740
That's the baseline
for this talk.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.610
Now my goal for all of you
is that this talk is, I hope,

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.290
exceedingly practical.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.090
I'm going to talk about
some specific ways

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.370
that I trained my
staff to do this,

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.020
the types of active
learning activities

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.850
we do, some lessons
we've learned,

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.960
how we've evaluated our success.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.590
I hope you'll be able to
apply some of these ideas

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.750
to your own classes if you want.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.570
I do want to start,
though, with a disclaimer.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.540
This is really a case study of
how active learning has worked

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.320
in 033.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.310
I'm not here to make claims
that active learning is

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.470
a solution to all of
your teaching problems.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.530
I think it's very good.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.940
It's probably not the
solution to everything.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.790
Nor am I even--

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.590
I'm not even here to
really evangelize it

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.061
over any other particular
pedagogical schemes.

00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:41.560
I think it works well in 033,
I think we've done some really

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.642
cool things.

00:09:42.642 --> 00:09:44.350
I hope you're excited
to hear about them.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:48.610
So active learning.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.590
As you've probably
picked up at this point,

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.620
what I'm going to talk about,
we're infusing the recitations

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.192
in 033 with active learning.

00:09:55.192 --> 00:09:56.650
And so that means
that really it is

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.560
my recitation instructors
who are on the ground doing

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.610
a lot of this.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.730
And I will admit, when
we were starting out,

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.590
I sort of thought--

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.550
I had this amazing idea to do
active learning recitations.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.410
And I was like, well, I am done.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.030
I have solved the problem.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.160
I just told my instructors
to implement it.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.100
It was like, guys,
active learning.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.530
It didn't work.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:25.150
I was perplexed, because I
told my instructors correctly

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.980
that these types
of activities would

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.780
help increase participation.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.120
My instructors were the ones
complaining about the lack

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.110
of participation.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.580
And so I just thought come
on, what's the problem.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.600
Well it turns out you cannot
tell your instructors to do

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.000
a thing that they've never
done before and just have them

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.470
magically do it.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.420
In particular, you can't
tell your instructors

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.940
to fundamentally change
the way they teach

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.040
and magically have that happen.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.720
I would say it's
difficult enough

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.150
for us to change
the way we teach,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.900
much less to get other people
to change the way they teach.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.430
So the first part of
my talk is changing

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.130
the way other people
teach in four easy steps.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.550
So step one is get
everyone on board.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.110
So this is the first thing
that I did, last year in 033.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.450
I will keep saying last
semester, but last year.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.540
I presented active learning
as our primary goal

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.430
for the entire semester.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.720
So we did not wait until
the course got settled down

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.840
to start doing it.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.230
In fact, our very
first staff meeting,

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.350
which happens before the
semester has even begun,

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.090
was about active learning.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.750
We had everyone on
the staff there.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.500
So me, all of my
recitation instructors,

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.140
all of my TAs, all of the
communication instructors.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:42.400
This is about 30
some people here.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.380
And we talked about
active learning.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.380
We talked about why it's a good
idea, the evidence that it's

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.440
a good idea, evidence that
it is better than lecturing.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.830
We talked about why running the
recitations in this way would

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.190
support the other learning
objectives in 033,

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.490
in particular the objective
of getting students to design

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.704
their own systems and
evaluate their own tradeoffs.

00:12:03.704 --> 00:12:05.620
I explained to my
instructors that there would

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.320
be extensive support for this.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.140
And that we'd be checking
in throughout the semester

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.240
to make sure this was
really working for them

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.720
and working for the students.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.980
Now I did expect some pushback
on this in this meeting.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:25.210
Partly, I am asking a
lot of my staff here.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.340
And also, I am a
lecturer in charge

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.350
of a lot of faculty, who have
been here for a very long time.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.740
So I was not quite
sure how this would go.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.660
I do not know if my
staff knew about this.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.240
I actually went so far in
preparing for this staff

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.570
meeting to not only write
out all of my objectives

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.610
and why active learning
was a good idea,

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.780
but to write my own rebuttal
to myself and then rebut that.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.350
So I sort of had, OK, if
I didn't want to do this,

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.935
I'd be asking--
well, I don't think

00:12:51.935 --> 00:12:53.560
active learning is
a good idea, I don't

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.726
think this is going to work.

00:12:54.726 --> 00:12:57.400
And I had prepared answers
for all of these questions.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.160
I looked at the notes for that
meeting to prepare for this.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.370
And it really went
on for quite a while.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.820
I did not actually get
that much pushback here,

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.390
because my staff is amazing.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.790
But also, I talked to a few of
my instructors ahead of time

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.280
about this, people who
had been with the class

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.150
for a while, who I knew would
be maybe a little bit more game

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.620
for this idea.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.370
I kind of got them
on board first.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.630
I also appealed to
everyone's scientific nature,

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.930
explaining that this was
somewhat of a research

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.570
project, which was true.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.800
I did want to know
would this work in 033.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.590
I was heavily biased
towards the fact

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.090
that I thought it
was going to work.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:40.530
But we had methods to evaluate
this throughout the semester.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.150
And I told them if
this goes horribly,

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.600
we won't keep doing it.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.530
I'm not going to
burden you with this.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.080
And I enthusiastically
mandated that this is what we

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.850
were trained for this semester.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.100
In previous semesters,
I had suggested

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.230
some of these ideas,
encouraged my staff to try it.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.570
And that really wasn't enough.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.160
And so on the one hand,
get everyone on board.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.480
It was one staff meeting.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.130
I will say, it was
really tempting

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.370
for me to not have that
staff meeting so soon.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.500
033 is such a big class.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.112
It has so many people involved.

00:14:15.112 --> 00:14:16.570
It feels like we're
just scrambling

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.330
to get the logistics worked
out in the first week or two.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.520
Even for us assigning
our students to sections

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.890
is this whole thing.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.490
But doing this really set the
tone for the whole semester.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.759
I was kind of surprised
at how helpful this was.

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:33.800
Everybody knew the active
learning was important.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.350
Even the people who weren't
the recitation instructors,

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.560
all the TAs, all the
communications instructors,

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.090
they knew that it
wasn't optional.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.460
It was their primary
goal of the semester.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.260
Any other changes that
we made in the class

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.770
were largely going to be
in support of this goal.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.010
So step one, get everybody
on board with your mission.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.170
Step two is do a lot of
work, do a lot of planning.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.440
So step one was our
first staff meeting.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.592
Step two, what's happening
in our second staff meeting.

00:15:01.592 --> 00:15:03.050
So one of the things
that we did is

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.920
we talked about a pretty
well-known list of something

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.850
like 278 different active
learning activities.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.060
I knew it was a
lot to ask really

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.090
anyone to read through all 278
active learning activities.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.610
And so I annotated this list.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.770
And we kind of
discussed the highlights

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.080
in the staff meeting.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.110
I am going to go into detail in
the second part of this class

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.440
about some of the specific
activities we do in 033,

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.140
but I'll give you some
examples from this list just

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.577
for concreteness.

00:15:34.577 --> 00:15:37.160
So one of them, which I really
like to do in lecture actually,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.866
is--

00:15:37.866 --> 00:15:38.990
they all have funny names--

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.000
OK, so fingers on chest.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.537
So this is having students vote
on a multiple choice question,

00:15:44.537 --> 00:15:46.120
but using like fingers
on their chest.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.110
So option one, option
two, option three.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.179
And that way, the
students can't see what

00:15:50.179 --> 00:15:51.470
other people are voting really.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.110
They're not quite like,
oh, everybody else

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.140
is voting for one.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.701
They can't really see, so
they tend to be more truthful.

00:15:57.701 --> 00:15:59.450
A lot of times in
lecture, I ask them just

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.824
do they feel good
about something

00:16:00.824 --> 00:16:02.570
or bad about something.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:06.470
Another one, a fairly common
one-- think, pair, share.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.660
So posing a question
to the class,

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.910
asking students
to think about it,

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:14.210
then to share their
ideas with a partner.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.630
And then maybe go and
address the larger class.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.310
And then a third one,
which I like just

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.870
because it has a nice name--

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.140
the name for it
is human Tableau.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.980
And so this is
having groups create

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.410
living scenes which
relate to the classroom

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.170
concepts or discussion.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.060
So that one's a little
bit more out there.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.170
But these are the
types of activities

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.702
we're thinking about.

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:36.410
And of course, we went
through this list.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.118
We looked at a whole
bunch of activities.

00:16:38.118 --> 00:16:41.680
We're not going to end up
using all of them in 033.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.570
But going through those list,
it was a really good exercise

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.740
for all of us.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.450
It gave everyone a
much better sense

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.870
of what is active learning or
what can active learning be.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.650
But even kind of
armed with that list,

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.470
it's still a lot to
tell your instructors,

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:02.910
here's your 278 activities,
now go, now do active learning.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.780
So in addition to
this, I pre-planned

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.760
a lot of active
learning techniques

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.950
into each recitation.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:11.990
So normally, before
active learning,

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.300
the way that I would
plan recitations

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.819
was strictly just for
technical content.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:18.710
I would give my
instructors a handful

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.440
of major technical issues
they needed to hit on.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.710
It helps keep our
recitations somewhat uniform

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.960
so that we can be fair on exams.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.850
We do test the
technical material

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.570
on exams in this class.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.150
Beyond that though,
my instructors

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.030
have a lot of leeway to
teach these topics however

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.880
they want, a lot of leeway
on how they teach in general.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.620
I had never before
tried to steer them

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.820
in a particular direction.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.380
But now, in addition to
that technical content,

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.990
what I would do is I would put
two or three active learning

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:51.470
activities or techniques
into each recitation.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.930
So things like
pointing out places

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.030
where they could have
students break into groups

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.700
and think about a particular
question, pointing out

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.820
places where they could
hold a debate in the class.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.400
And again, I'm going to talk
about these specific activities

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.965
we do in the second
part of this talk.

00:18:06.965 --> 00:18:09.230
But planning
activities in this way

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.910
meant that my
instructors has had

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.130
a lot of ideas of
how they can make

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.020
this work in their sections.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.665
Giving them multiple ideas and
multiple types of ideas really

00:18:18.665 --> 00:18:20.540
meant that they could
pick the ones that they

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.040
were the most comfortable with.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.290
So instead of saying, hey,
here's this really, really

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.290
out there idea, everybody
go try it, some of them

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.570
might try some of the
more extreme ones,

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.670
but everybody could
kind of find something

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.620
that they were comfortable with.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.090
So get everybody on
board, plan things,

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.920
And the next thing that I
did was support my staff

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.550
as individuals.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.310
So I didn't plan
these activities

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.960
and set the staff free.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.220
I actually observed them
throughout the semester.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.970
And I made sure
to stress that it

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.560
wasn't any sort of evaluation.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.220
I was not there to
say, oh, boy, Karen,

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.694
this is really not working out.

00:18:57.694 --> 00:18:59.360
I was just there to
see what was working

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.430
and what wasn't, so
that we could all

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.710
iterate on these things.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.350
In practice, this was great.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.620
I, of course, found
way more good things

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.610
in doing this than
anything problematic.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.190
Most of my feedback
to my instructors

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.170
was, hey, you did this
really awesome thing,

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:16.753
you should do more
of that, and can we

00:19:16.753 --> 00:19:18.270
share it with everybody else.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.435
And so, I really,
in the end kind

00:19:20.435 --> 00:19:22.560
of thought of myself more
as a cheerleader for them

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.000
and what they were doing,
than someone who was coming in

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.310
are really critiquing anything.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.190
I also got a lot of
great ideas from them,

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.812
both in how to present certain
technical content and twists

00:19:34.812 --> 00:19:36.520
on some of the active
learning techniques

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.320
that I had suggested.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.160
So related to that, I'm
observing them as individuals,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.160
but we would also
talk a lot as a group

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.870
about how this was going.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.210
Every staff meeting
we'd take time

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:52.600
to talk about what went
well the previous week.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.150
Our instructors would
share active learning ideas

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.920
that they tried, report
on how they went.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.420
This was really nice.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.410
It got some of my more
hesitant instructors kind

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.930
of on board with this,
to say like, oh, well,

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.210
that person tried it and it
seemed like it went really

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:07.710
well.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.640
Maybe I'll try that next time.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.950
And of course, the
thing that turned out

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.490
to be so great about this,
is that all of my instructors

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.700
have these amazing ideas on
how to teach certain things.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.710
But to them, it
doesn't seem special,

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.130
like this is just always the way
I've taught operating systems.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.410
And so, now we have this
space where we're getting

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.030
to share all of these ideas.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.430
A lot of them relate to how
our active learning has gone.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.070
But sometimes it's just,
hey, I taught this paper

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.120
this really cool way.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.320
It has also-- the fact that
we've now kind of fostered

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.290
this space for discussion
at every staff meeting,

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.780
everybody is pretty
willing to bring up

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.850
things that aren't going as
well, to maybe come in and say,

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.030
hey, I tried this
active learning thing

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.994
and it did not work at all.

00:20:50.994 --> 00:20:51.910
What do you all think?

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.330
Is there something I could
have done differently?

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.360
Is this just not something
that will work for our class?

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.040
And so that has been
really, really great,

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.330
having this space for my staff
to kind of reflect on this

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.450
and not feel judged in any way.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:12.250
So this is the first part of
getting active learning to work

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:16.550
in 033, which was a
lot of staff training.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.830
But now the second part--

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.770
what do we actually do?

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:23.040
What are these activities?

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.160
I would like to give you some
specific examples from 033,

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.240
but I will also try to give you
some general feedback as well.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.420
I realize you probably won't be
able to take the 033 activities

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.620
exactly into your classes,
so let me talk about some

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.550
of the common things that we do.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.030
So these are things that
we've seen work really well

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.710
in our classes.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:48.220
So one of the most common types
of active learning that we do

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.070
is one I have already
referenced a lot, which

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:55.810
is to put students in small
groups, have them do something,

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.030
and then bring them back
for a class-wide discussion.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.600
So let me give you some
really specific examples.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.110
We have a recitation where we
talk about content distribution

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:06.100
networks.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.130
The paper they read
describes various goals

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.680
of those networks, so
performance, reliability,

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.920
scalability, things like this.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.420
And what we'll do
in that recitation

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.300
is we'll divide the
class up into groups.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.310
And we'll have each
group think about what

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.310
aspects of the system
support a particular goal.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:28.120
So you think about performance,
you think about reliability,

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.880
you think about
scalability, et cetera.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.430
And then we'll bring the
class back to a discussion

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.500
once they've thought
about that for a while.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.920
Another example, when we talk
about naming in the Unix file

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.370
system, we start by asking
them, what things have names?

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:43.810
What things in Unix have names?

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.310
And again, we'll
put them in groups.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.370
We'll try to get every group to
come up with as many things as

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:49.510
possible.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.490
Because when we bring
them back together,

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.870
we'll try to get a different
thing from every group.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.670
So you can't all
just say files, you

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.660
have to say like files, and
directories, and processes.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.440
And there's a lot of things
in Unix that have names.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.560
I'm not here to make
you Unix experts.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.690
And so, in both of those
examples, like I said,

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.570
we'll bring the class back
together for a discussion.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.020
We'll try to have each
group say something.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.860
And as I said before, we've
seen very clearly, talking

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.990
in these small
groups before hand,

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:24.430
really makes the shyer
students a lot more confident.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.610
And asking each group to
contribute to the discussion

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.520
means that we don't end up with
something that is dominated

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.160
by one or two groups.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.130
Often, we'll even be a little
bit more relaxed about it.

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:40.150
We will just ask a big question,
some sort of thought question,

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.265
not just a tell me this
fact from the paper.

00:23:43.265 --> 00:23:45.050
We'll break them up
in the small groups,

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.050
have them think about it,
and come back together

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.570
for a discussion.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.820
It's nice, it breaks
up the recitation.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.240
It gets them kind of
talking and doing things.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.500
We occasionally will have
our TAs teach in this class.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.510
And we encourage them to use
these techniques as well.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.600
And one of them asked me
a really good question

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.430
that I realized I had
never thought about.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:08.800
She said, what do I do
when they're in groups?

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.070
Like, do I just stand
there and stare at them?

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.770
Probably not, that's
probably not good.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.970
So to tell you what we do
while they're in groups,

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.446
sometimes our instructors
might actually check in

00:24:20.446 --> 00:24:21.820
with each group,
to say, oh, hey,

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.260
what are you guys
thinking about?

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.900
Sometimes, you're kind
of lightly monitoring,

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.210
you're walking around.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.730
I know when I cover
recitations, sometimes

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.327
I use it as time to prep for
the thing that is coming next.

00:24:33.327 --> 00:24:35.410
So if I need to draw
something on the board that's

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.550
going to take a minute,
I'll put you all in groups

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.880
so you can discuss
while I draw that.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.330
So this works really
well as a technique

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.450
to get students
engaged and talking,

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.010
and honestly, it's also nice
from a classroom management

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:48.709
perspective.

00:24:48.709 --> 00:24:51.250
It breaks things up, it gives
you a little break from talking

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.390
and you can drink some water.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:55.546
So that is kind of
our starting point.

00:24:55.546 --> 00:24:57.670
This is one thing where I
would say we do something

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.870
like this in almost every
single recitation, every Tuesday

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.250
and Thursday.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.220
The second one is one
that I really like,

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.960
which is to have
the students debate.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.160
It's a little bit harder
to work into a recitation.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.010
You need a question
that can be debated.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.280
For us, we have one
recitation where the students

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.230
read two short papers.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.799
And the papers actually come
to opposing conclusions.

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:24.590
And so it's an interesting
lesson for them,

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.410
well, how could this
happen in science?

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.890
How could data say
two different things?

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:35.640
It is mind-blowing for them,
honestly, it's pretty wild.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.790
And so we'll split
them into two teams.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:42.280
And we'll give them each
a paper, have them debate.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.130
The students usually
really like this.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.290
They love to argue, so they're
very excited to do this.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:51.580
It does involve a
bit more monitoring.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.700
You want to make sure that
one team, or one person,

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.470
or one team doesn't dominate.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:00.040
To combat that, we'll always
have the teams converse

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.350
beforehand, kind of get
your argument together

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.290
so you're ready to
prepare it for the class.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.600
I personally think something
like that could also

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.140
work in small groups.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.820
Maybe you have groups of
four, teams of two, debating.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.060
I will say, when I've taught
this recitation, of these two

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.550
papers, there's like a
clear winner in my mind.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:21.880
The last time I taught
this, the opposing team

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.400
made some very salient points.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.730
So they really do
well with this.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.370
So this one is one that
I think is really fun,

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.920
just a little bit more
difficult to work in

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.290
because of what it requires.

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.240
A third one, something
that we've actually

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.830
started doing more of this year,
is having them draw pictures.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:45.850
So we'll ask them, in
groups, to draw pictures

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:48.210
on the board of whatever
system we're talking about,

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.790
or maybe some component
of that system.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.350
And what we end up
with is a wide variety

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.700
of drawings of varying
levels of artistic skill.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.290
And we can come
together and talk about,

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.180
what is each drawing showing?

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.850
What are the common
things that we're seeing

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.380
in all of these depictions?

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.270
What level of abstraction
is each drawing capturing?

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:12.490
That's something that comes
up a lot for us in 033.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.280
I like this for a few reasons.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.420
For 033 specifically, part of
our communication curriculum

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.620
involves teaching the students
how to design and draw figures.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.610
So this, for us, this is just a
great way for them to practice.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.970
It also forces them to figure
out exactly what the system is

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.000
doing.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.880
And so we can expose
some areas where

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.320
they might have
missed something,

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.580
which always happens.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.520
We expect them to read the
papers before they come in.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.500
They should be able
to draw something.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.570
It might not be perfect, and
that gives us a great space

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.540
to explore that, like
why was this confusing?

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.400
What is it about the paper
that made this confusing?

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.900
It's also just fun.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.030
So the students get
a kick out of it.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:59.535
Now the last activity that I
want to talk about, this is,

00:27:59.535 --> 00:28:00.910
I'm going to say
that this is one

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.010
of our more extreme activities.

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.600
We actually do it
pretty frequently.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.300
We will have students
act things out.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.790
Also, the hardest
to make an icon for,

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.250
I just didn't know
what to do there.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.880
They're acting, you can tell.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.030
Now, I tell people about this
a lot, and whenever I say it,

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.670
like, oh, we act things
out in 033 all the time,

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.920
they are for sure intrigued.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.050
They are not sure exactly
what that would entail.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.470
So I was going to have
you all do this activity,

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:34.060
but we're half going
to do this activity.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.220
So I kind of want to go
through one of our examples

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.640
actually in detail.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.302
We have them act out a
system called MapReduce.

00:28:41.302 --> 00:28:42.760
But for this to
make any sense, you

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.970
need to understand a little
bit about what MapReduce does.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.340
So you're going to become--

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.280
I don't want to say
MapReduce experts,

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.230
MapReduce novices for
the next five minutes.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:57.090
All right, so, brief aside
of technical material.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.200
MapReduce is this
system for performing

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.330
parallel computation.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.000
And so here's the
canonical example.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.970
We have a large piece of text.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:10.240
The Library of Congress
has a lot of books in it.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.520
These books, we're
going to digitize this,

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.920
and so the data from
these books is spread out

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.590
on all different machines.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.060
So we have a lot of computers.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.160
Let's say, you all
can be computers.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.910
So each one of you has a book
from the Library of Congress.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:27.700
And here's the problem
that we want to solve,

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.410
the canonical MapReduce problem.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:32.170
We want to count the
number of occurrences

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.952
of each word in
this entire corpus.

00:29:34.952 --> 00:29:36.910
So I want to know, how
many times does the word

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.240
apple appear?

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.480
How many times does
the word ball appear?

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.310
How many times does
the word the appear?

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.180
OK?

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.119
It's the canonical problem.

00:29:45.119 --> 00:29:47.410
You all don't look like you
actually want to know that.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.930
You do, you want to know
how many times the word

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.850
apple occurs in the
Library of Congress.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:57.400
So you can imagine doing
that with one computer, where

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.370
that computer just reads
every book in sequence

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.760
and keeps track of these counts.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.880
And that would be very slow.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.880
So instead, what we
can do is we can have

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.250
multiple computers participate.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.280
You all have a portion of
the Library of Congress.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.180
You all can read your data.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:17.090
You can make accounts
for your pieces of data.

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:19.630
This is the map phase.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.980
And then we need some way to
kind of combine those results.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.830
So if Dipa finds that the
word apple occurred five times

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:29.150
in her text, if Jesse found
that it occurred six times,

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:30.820
I need some way to add those up.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.900
That would be the reduce phase.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.960
And so part of the
insight of this system

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.930
is that there are a lot of
common problems in computer

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.576
science that can be
described this way.

00:30:40.576 --> 00:30:42.200
This is a system that
came from Google.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.350
So Google is doing this
on your data all the time.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.840
They are mapping and reducing
everything about you.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.580
So let's see how that
would actually work,

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.320
how this system would work.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.264
Jessie, come play your
role in this thing.

00:30:55.264 --> 00:30:56.680
JESSIE: Do I have
to wear the hat?

00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.300
PROFESSOR: You do have to wear
the hat, it's active learning.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.200
I've got to write master on it.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.231
JESSIE: I'm ready.

00:31:07.231 --> 00:31:08.980
PROFESSOR: I think a
lot of things in life

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.307
should be more fun.

00:31:10.307 --> 00:31:12.640
So there's really no reason
for Jessie to wear this hat.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.730
But there's also not a reason
for her not to wear this hat.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:16.230
So--

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.172
JESSIE: There might be a reason.

00:31:18.172 --> 00:31:22.044
AUDIENCE: This is about
who this is fun for.

00:31:22.044 --> 00:31:24.779
JESSIE: Fortunately, I can't see
you, so now I feel comfortable.

00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:27.070
PROFESSOR: Well, you can tilt
the hat back a little bit

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:27.760
maybe.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.820
So in MapReduce, there
is the one machine

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.480
that acts as the coordination
for this, the master machine,

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.520
as Jessie is so--

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.960
doing such a great
job acting for us.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.920
And so what the
master's job would be--

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.430
you don't have-- you're just--

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:43.900
we just want to visualize you.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.790
You're just a prop, yes.

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.980
So it would start by
assigning jobs to workers.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.400
Now you all, I didn't make hats
for all of you, there wasn't--

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.610
I know, I'm very sorry,
but you're all workers.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.354
Only the master gets a hat.

00:31:56.354 --> 00:31:57.770
All right, so you
are all workers.

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:01.660
So one of the first things
Master Jessie would do,

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.470
would be to assign
map jobs to workers.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.810
And she would tell you
things like exactly what data

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:08.740
to operate on.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.830
So imagine a scenario where
you, a worker machine,

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.664
has data from a ton of
different corpuses on it.

00:32:15.664 --> 00:32:17.080
So Jessie actually
has to say, OK,

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.267
worry about the Library of
Congress part of your data.

00:32:20.267 --> 00:32:21.850
And you would begin
operating on that.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:24.245
You'd count your words.

00:32:24.245 --> 00:32:27.100
And you'd write out some
results to your disk,

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.359
that you also have
as a machine in this.

00:32:29.359 --> 00:32:31.900
And then when you were done,
you would report back to Jessie.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.626
And you'd tell her some various
meta information, kind of like,

00:32:35.626 --> 00:32:37.000
these are the
words that I found.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.840
You don't have to send
her all of your results,

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.464
because the Library of Congress
is big, you have a lot of data.

00:32:41.464 --> 00:32:45.280
But you might tell Jessie,
hey, I found apple.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.340
Now, once all of you are
finished doing your map jobs,

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.090
Jessie has all of this
kind of meta information,

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.882
she can start assigning
the reduce jobs.

00:32:53.882 --> 00:32:55.840
And the reduce jobs are
a little bit different.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.205
So Dipa if it was your job to
reduce, say, the word apple,

00:32:59.205 --> 00:33:00.580
you need to know
a couple things.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.705
You need to know, well,
which one of these machines

00:33:02.705 --> 00:33:04.360
actually found the word apple.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.830
It's not necessarily
they're going

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.051
to be in every piece of data.

00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:08.800
And Jessie would be
able to tell you that.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.650
She'd basically say, hey,
Dipa contact these workers,

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:15.190
they have the data you need,
you can add them together,

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.140
in this example.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.570
MapReduce functions can be
much more complex than this.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:21.360
I thought let's start slow.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.940
All right, so the reduce
workers would go, you'd reduce,

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.980
you'd report results
back to Jessie,

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.359
and then we'd have
our full counts.

00:33:30.359 --> 00:33:32.650
I'm trying to decide how long
I want you to stand here,

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:34.900
and the answer is for
the rest of the talk,

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.540
but you can almost sit down.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.290
All right, so this
is the basic--

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.300
JESSIE: I thought I'd
have more work to do.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.008
PROFESSOR: I thought
that would be a lot.

00:33:42.008 --> 00:33:44.260
I didn't prep you for that.

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.190
Don't go yet, though.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.140
JESSIE: I'm just moving over.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.370
PROFESSOR: So this is the
basic idea of MapReduce.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:51.380
This is the type of thing
we'd actually expect

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.850
the students to know coming in.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.820
They've read the paper, and
they should understand this sort

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.680
of level of coordination.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.680
But there are a lot of
details that we left out.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.440
For instance, I didn't
ask you all, hey, what

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.880
happens if a machine fails?

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.460
Worker Dipa crashes,
what do we do?

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.659
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:10.310
PROFESSOR: All the time, right?

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.560
Is that data that she
was storing, is it

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.120
anywhere else in the system?

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.110
How do we know?

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:17.600
What if she had half
finished the job?

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.659
What do we do?

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:21.110
Or even, what if there was
no crash, but like let's say

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.900
the worker Janet is just running
really slow, like she's going,

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:30.320
she's working hard, but
everyone else is finished

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.480
and we're just waiting on Janet.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.399
And these are those
types of things.

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:36.440
Those are the interesting
things about MapReduce.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.080
That's the point where there
are tradeoffs for the students

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:39.706
to think about.

00:34:39.706 --> 00:34:41.455
So it's not just
important to think about,

00:34:41.455 --> 00:34:44.090
oh gosh, what does happen if
a machine crashes or is slow,

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:46.440
but why does it happen that way.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:52.040
So to do this, we actually
have them act out this system.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.929
And from the way that
I've described it here,

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:56.330
you might think, well, I have
one student be the master

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.100
and everybody else
is a worker, that's

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.740
kind of what I was
setting you all up for.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.200
This is not actually
how we do it.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.650
Normally-- for one, it
doesn't work with the size

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:07.860
of our recitations.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.600
Even here, this is a lot
of workers for one student

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.820
to be in charge of.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:16.010
And also, if Jessie was
maybe more of a shy student,

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:20.000
she's like this is the
worst day of my entire life.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.090
Katrina has made me wear a
hat, and I have to stand--

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:26.190
I am in charge of
everything, it's not good.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.140
It's not good.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:31.072
So in practice, here's
how we do this activity.

00:35:31.072 --> 00:35:32.280
You can sit down if you want.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.310
You don't have to
be here anymore.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.685
JESSIE: Should I
keep the hat on?

00:35:34.685 --> 00:35:36.560
PROFESSOR: I think,
definitely, yes.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.020
I think absolutely.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.990
So we do start by
assigning students roles.

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.100
But we will usually
have them in teams.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.220
So there will be a master team.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:49.670
Each worker will be a team of
maybe two or three students.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.950
This is good for
a lot of reasons.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:56.120
Again, for the reason of
getting the shyer students

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.840
to be a little bit
more comfortable,

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.010
no one student is in
charge of something.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.220
From a logistical
standpoint, again, I

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.980
glazed over many a
detail in MapReduce,

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.920
but you can imagine that
the master has a lot to do,

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.480
a lot to keep track of.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.870
And so we will often,
we'll have our master team.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:17.940
And we'll actually give each
student in that team a task.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:22.130
So one might run the
clock, timing in the system

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.890
is important.

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.920
We'll see an example
of that in a second.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.250
One keeps track of what
map tasks to complete.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.400
One assigns the tasks,
things like that.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.920
We have found-- we've
actually done this activity

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.270
a number of times.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:36.900
It gets better every time.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.710
One of the things we
learned the most quickly

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.240
is that the master--
we had to give

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.240
the students who were
doing the master extremely

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.510
detailed instructions.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:47.020
If we just said do
the master's job,

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:48.920
they were not ready for that.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.230
In some sections, in fact,
some of my instructors

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:54.290
prefer to do this where the
instructor just is the master,

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:57.170
and so they can be kind of
in charge of coordination.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:00.200
Workers in this example get a
little bit of an easier job.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.810
Again, we're putting them
in teams of two to three.

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:06.050
Sometimes we might give them
a sheet with words on it,

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.810
and actually ask them
to count the words.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:12.050
Sometimes we'll give them
a sheet that kind of just

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:15.290
says here's the words in your
data and here are the counts.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.560
That might seem like, oh,
gosh what's the point,

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.930
they're not actually
doing the worker job.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:24.650
Counting the words in the text
is not the interesting part

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:25.740
of this system.

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.500
So sometimes we'll
just skip that.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.860
It also, again, lets us do
some very precise things

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.300
with timing.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.220
So once these
roles are assigned,

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.410
we're going to run the protocol.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:39.260
So the person keeping
track of the master clock

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.920
will advance it, one click,
two clicks, et cetera.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.680
Various map jobs will complete.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.930
Most of the time, when we
give them a paper that says,

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:50.390
here's your words and your
counts, we'll also say,

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:53.610
hey, it takes three clock
cycles for you to complete.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:56.300
And so once the clock
has ticked three times,

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.300
they'll report back
to the master team.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.120
Because of how we set up
those map tasks, some of them

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.350
will also fail.

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:06.320
Some of them will have
papers that say, oh, I

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.460
failed after click two.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.740
And they have to
announce it to the class.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.660
And at that point, we pause.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.260
What happens?

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.870
What happens when
a machine fails?

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:16.470
What does MapReduce do?

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.836
Why does it do that?

00:38:18.836 --> 00:38:21.420
The spoiler for you all
in MapReduce, the master

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.300
will reassign that
task to somewhere else.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.370
And part of that
challenge is making sure

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:28.070
that the new worker has
access to the data that

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.630
was on the crashed machine.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:33.262
MapReduce replicates data, so
we talk about how that happens.

00:38:33.262 --> 00:38:35.240
And the protocol continues.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.630
The students will find that one
map task, it hasn't crashed,

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.950
but it's taking
a very long time.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:43.130
And that's another good
point for discussion.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:44.600
What does MapReduce do?

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.370
Does it just wait?

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:49.490
In practice, it restarts
the task in another machine.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:51.950
And then, so, oh, there's a
question, these two machines

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:53.930
are running the same thing.

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:54.597
What do we do?

00:38:54.597 --> 00:38:55.430
Who do we listen to?

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:57.110
How do we get the data?

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:01.280
And this is why the timing of
that activity is so important,

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.740
because a lot of the discussion
points about MapReduce

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:08.150
come from what we do when things
are slow or when things fail.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:11.640
So being in control of
that timing is crucial.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.780
We do have some variations
on this activity though.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:18.050
One of our instructors this year
had students count characters

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:20.150
instead of words, same idea.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:24.860
But of the workers was
counting Russian characters

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:25.850
instead of English.

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:28.490
So they just organically were
much slower than the rest

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:29.570
of the class.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:32.570
And that was kind of a
nice way to show that.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.030
Many of our instructors
have the students

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.490
count types of candy
instead of words.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:39.770
And we bring them candy.

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:41.850
That's a big hit.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:44.270
In fact, after we did
this recitation this year,

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.120
one of our students asked
why can't every recitation

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.770
be like the MapReduce one.

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:51.260
It is not clear
how much the candy

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.990
factored into that question.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:55.820
So it has taken us
quite a few iterations

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.640
to get that activity working.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.530
And again, I know
you're not all teaching

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:01.760
MapReduce in your courses.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.010
You're not going to take
that activity to you.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.910
But the things that
were interesting for us,

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.950
having the students in teams
for each of these roles

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.590
made a huge difference,
both in terms

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:15.252
of making sure they were all
doing the correct things,

00:40:15.252 --> 00:40:17.210
but just getting them
more comfortable with it.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:19.370
I will tell you, the
students go for this.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:20.450
They are into it.

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:21.890
They map and reduce.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:26.210
They do not think it's stupid,
which is very, very nice.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:30.080
And making sure that the master
has these exceedingly detailed

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.410
instructions, figuring out
how to make the timing work,

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:35.780
so that all of the things
we wanted to discuss

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.132
would actually happen.

00:40:38.132 --> 00:40:40.340
And so really the activity
is the way I describe it--

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.710
Karen, this is
how Karen does it.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:46.170
Karen, you're the authoritative
source on how we do MapReduce--

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:47.210
yeah.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:50.300
I want to talk briefly about
another system we act out

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.101
because it's fun.

00:40:51.101 --> 00:40:52.850
It's one of my favorite
things that we do.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:53.870
It's much shorter.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:56.240
We do this for a
system called Raft.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.480
And Raft, like MapReduce is
this large distributed system

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.100
on a lot of machines.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.390
Timing is also
important in Raft.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:07.350
In particular, machines
set randomized timers.

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.830
I picked some random number
of seconds, milliseconds,

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:11.290
whatever.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:14.820
And when that timer
expires, they do something.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:17.990
So being able to act that out
is actually really crucial.

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:21.801
And we thought, gosh, how are
we going to randomize them?

00:41:21.801 --> 00:41:23.300
And so one of my
instructors came up

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.960
with the best idea, which is to
have the students spin around

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.770
in a circle.

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:30.470
So like literally,
they're standing here,

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:35.600
and then they kind of-- they
do this, and it takes a while.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.970
Because he figured
out that students

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:40.220
just walk around naturally
at different paces.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.240
So they've effectively
randomized themselves.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.750
Someone will finish first.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.385
So I need you to imagine feel
like you're walking around MIT,

00:41:47.385 --> 00:41:48.760
and you're just
kind of like, oh,

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.010
what's going on in this class.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.190
And you see seven
or eight students up

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.980
at the front of the room just
very quietly spinning around

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:57.500
in place, while all of the
other students are like--

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.990
the person who
finishes first wins.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:03.200
And so who-- who is it?

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.170
Who's going to be the next
leader of this election

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:06.950
cycle in Raft.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:09.350
It's really-- it
looks ridiculous,

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:10.320
but it works so well.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.370
And it brings me a lot of joy.

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.130
So to kind of wrap
up our activities

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.995
before I get to results,
effectively, how

00:42:18.995 --> 00:42:20.510
has this worked for us--

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:22.820
again, we do all of
these things a lot.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.040
This one in particular,
small groups,

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.660
a class wide discussion--

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.180
although acting things out, we
act a lot of things out now.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.870
We've gotten pretty
good at that.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.020
And the key component for
us has been recognizing

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.300
in all of these
cases, the students

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.940
are more comfortable if they're
not doing something alone,

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.700
if they have at least one other
person on their team doing

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:44.550
whatever it is they need
to do in that recitation.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:48.980
And since we do something
like this in every recitation,

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.470
the students just
come to expect it.

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:52.660
I mean, they go for it.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.610
Sometimes, I'll come in
and cover a recitation.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:58.070
And despite
observations, I'm never

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:01.016
exactly sure how my
instructors are leaving things.

00:43:01.016 --> 00:43:02.390
And so, I always
start by asking,

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.970
like, hey, I'm going to
put you all in groups,

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:06.890
is that something
you're used to.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.140
Every time, they're
like, yeah, we

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.720
do that every day, like of
course we can get into groups.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.650
So again, even acting things
out, they really go for it.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:18.260
We try to vary the
types of activities

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.480
that we do each week, to
keep everyone engaged,

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.100
to keep things interesting.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.050
It's hard to act
ever system out.

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:29.360
And there's occasions where
an activity doesn't work.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.960
The first time we tried
MapReduce, it was chaos.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.917
But we thought it
was a cool thing.

00:43:34.917 --> 00:43:35.750
So we just iterated.

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:37.940
We just tried it again
the next semester.

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.280
And in planning
all of these, we're

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.390
still very careful to make sure
that our activities actually

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:46.460
teach them things.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.680
Like I said, all
of the recitations

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.550
have technical points
that they have to hit on.

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:53.840
A MapReduce activity
where they just

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.950
act out the system in its normal
use case, it would be fun,

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:59.840
but they're supposed to
come in knowing that.

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:03.650
So we really want to
design these activities

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:05.940
so that we're hitting on the
points we need to hit on.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.800
So there is a lot of
planning that goes into this.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.700
So now, for the final
part, did it work?

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.520
What got better?

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:18.640
I'll start with a few
actually quantitative things.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.910
Sometimes when I tell
people about this endeavor,

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:23.720
they want to know,
are grades better?

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.270
Have the students'
grades improved?

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.320
How are they doing on exams?

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.730
I don't personally think that
that's the right question.

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:33.790
There is one aspect of
grading that has improved--

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:35.290
participation grades.

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:38.740
We assign a pretty large
portion of the final grade

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.630
to participation in recitation.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:42.340
Again, we're asking
a lot of them.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.450
We're expecting them to
demonstrate certain skills

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.930
in recitation, so they
are graded accordingly.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:49.540
And we're seeing students earn
higher participation grades

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.260
now.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.480
I'm comfortable
interpreting that as they

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.070
are participating more.

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:56.140
We are also giving them
a lot more opportunities

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.580
to participate.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:59.267
Related to that,
one of the things

00:44:59.267 --> 00:45:00.850
that we've gained
from this experience

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:03.880
is just a better
understanding of what it means

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.490
to participate in our class.

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:08.890
For a long time
to us, it kind of

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:11.320
meant, well, does this
student answer questions

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.240
when I ask them a question.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.789
But now it means, are they
coming prepared to class?

00:45:15.789 --> 00:45:17.080
Are they engaged in group work?

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.580
Are they listening
to other students

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:19.750
and to their instructor?

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:22.250
Are they participating in
class wide discussions?

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:25.450
There is more opportunities
for students to participate.

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:29.030
We are much clearer about
how we assign this grade.

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:30.940
So not only have
the grades improved,

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:35.760
but the students are noticeably
more relaxed about this grade.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.690
I get fewer complaints
about this grade,

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:39.130
which is great for me.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:41.530
And they know that if they
come prepared and ready to do

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:44.007
the work, they'll be fine.

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:45.590
AUDIENCE: The grade
for the recitation

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:47.850
is separate from
the course grade?

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:50.800
PROFESSOR: It's part of the
final grade in the course.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.020
A percentage of the final
grade is from participation

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.430
in recitation.

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:59.620
So we also surveyed the
students during the semester.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:01.720
And we were largely
asking questions about

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:05.530
do you feel comfortable
in the recitations.

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:08.380
Largely, yes, they did.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.660
In our final survey,
overwhelmingly the students

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:14.120
felt that these activities
improved their engagement.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.724
So these things are all good.

00:46:16.724 --> 00:46:18.140
I don't think they
really captured

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:20.960
though what has been so
great about this endeavor

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.350
for our class.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:25.160
And so in preparing
this talk, I spoke

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.050
to a couple of
instructors who have been

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.710
with me for a number of years.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:31.910
So they've seen the class
through its non-active learning

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:36.620
era, through the dark times,
as well as the current era.

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:39.470
And so I stole a few quotes
from them to kind of sum

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.840
up what I think is made
this approach better

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.230
for the students.

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:44.540
So let's turn to number one.

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:47.120
The first is that I think the
students actually understand

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.650
the algorithms better.

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:50.930
In particular, if we're
acting something out,

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:53.270
it gives them a visceral
experience of the finer points

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:54.800
and edge conditions.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.660
It's really easy to
slide over things

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:58.460
if one reads a paper
quickly, and we're

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.900
asking them to read a lot.

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.720
Second instructor, I think
that it's much better when

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.550
there are pairs
discussing a solution

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:07.290
or when we're doing a game.

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:10.020
People are more likely to notice
a flaw in something I've said

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.490
or in someone else's answer.

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:13.500
And they ask better questions.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.270
Plus, I think it's
reassuring either

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:17.970
to find out that a classmate
is just as confused

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:21.021
or to find out that a classmate
knows a ton about the subject.

00:47:21.021 --> 00:47:22.520
And then the last
one, which I think

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.520
really sums up how things
have been for our students,

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.590
is this one.

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:29.090
I think the students are more
engaged because they are asked

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:31.040
to be more active participants.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.350
There's a greater sense of
camaraderie between them

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:35.790
because of their interactions.

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:37.880
So we're seeing these
students understanding

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.370
the details of the systems
better, while developing

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:41.930
this sense of camaraderie.

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:44.690
And honestly, that
has been huge for us.

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:46.940
Largely, I would say,
from my perspective

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:48.770
as the person in
charge, students

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:52.280
are buying into this class
more than they used to.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.250
I get fewer complaints
across the board.

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:57.620
We're seeing them
work better together

00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:59.430
in their team projects.

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:01.190
We're seeing them
be more engaged

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:04.820
in lecture and in tutorial, even
though recitations was really

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:07.672
where this active
learning push happened.

00:48:07.672 --> 00:48:09.380
And this whole thing
has been beneficial,

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:14.277
not just for the students,
but also for the staff.

00:48:14.277 --> 00:48:15.860
There was a little
hesitance at first.

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:18.090
Active learning
can be a hard sell.

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:20.510
It involves more
work for everyone.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:22.050
It takes a lot of planning.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:24.410
It can be a nerve-wracking
way to teach if you've never

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:25.390
taught it before.

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:27.380
Imagine coming into
a room of students

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.032
you don't know very well,
and say, OK, five of your

00:48:30.032 --> 00:48:31.490
are going to be on
the master team,

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:34.010
let's go, I made
you all hats, right?

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:38.670
But now, one of my
instructors said,

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:40.490
there's a modest
amount of competition

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:44.180
among the recitation instructors
to work out schemes and games.

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:47.420
So it feels like there's both
a reward for applying myself,

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:50.204
but there's also less
need for perfection.

00:48:50.204 --> 00:48:51.620
It's helped that
we're encouraging

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:53.930
active learning is an
approach, because it makes

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:55.580
it feel like less
of a risk for me

00:48:55.580 --> 00:49:00.020
to try some new unconventional
approach that occurs to me.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:03.020
So I'll tell you one of
the highlights for me,

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.600
as a person sort of
overseeing this operation.

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.182
So this happened at the
end of last semester.

00:49:08.182 --> 00:49:09.890
Again, that's the
first time we're really

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:11.634
putting this scheme into place.

00:49:11.634 --> 00:49:13.050
And near the end,
my instructors--

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.810
I got this email
from the instructors

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:17.139
about one of the
final recitations.

00:49:17.139 --> 00:49:18.680
And the recitation
was about a system

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.740
called DNS SEC, secure DNS.

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:23.240
So it deals with security.

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:27.210
DNS prevents certain types of
attacks on a system called DNS.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:28.910
That's all you need
to know DNS SEC.

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:31.080
So the first instructor
described an activity

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:34.310
they had done, where they
had groups draw diagrams

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:36.729
of their attacks on
the board in parallel

00:49:36.729 --> 00:49:38.270
and then talked
through each diagram,

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:41.680
with the students explaining
the problems and the approaches.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:44.330
And the instructor
noted that they engaged,

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:47.330
they laughed, they collaborated,
they learned more about

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:50.480
how design figures to tell
the story they wanted to tell.

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.700
And I got this email,
and I was so excited.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.280
Because this was not an activity
that I had planned for them.

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.120
This is just something
they had done.

00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.320
And I thought, it's happened,
finally it's happened.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.910
And then I get a second email.

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:03.890
And so a second
instructor responded

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:05.600
saying that that sounded great.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.030
And what they had done,
they'd had a group of students

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:11.270
work out how DNS would work
for a particular scenario, so

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:13.040
the original system.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.950
And then two additional groups
joined that first group,

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:18.320
worked through how
different attacks would

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.980
affect that scenario.

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.460
And then a fourth
group acted as DNS SEC,

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:25.770
and explain how DNS SEC
would prevent such attacks.

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:28.930
So to brand new ideas,
both really good,

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:30.050
both really different.

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:31.460
And this is so exciting.

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.560
And then we get to
instructor number three.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.180
And I've never been
able to figure out

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.160
a way to summarize this email.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.950
So I have to quote
it for you directly.

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:42.320
"In my recitation, we
had a marriage proposal

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.290
that went bad when a romantic
rival launched an attack

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:46.910
to destroy the relationship.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.710
A second group used
a different attack

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:52.070
to induce peasants to send
their taxes to a scammer.

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:53.840
All of these attacks
were then prevented

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.850
by the use of DNS SEC.

00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:59.540
After each play, we did a replay
with deep structure analysis

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:03.080
that made the analogy between
the play and DNS explicit.

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.360
Overall, a pretty
fun recitation and I

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.760
was impressed with the
creativity, enthusiasm,

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:11.430
and acting talent the
students displayed."

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:12.507
So this was amazing.

00:51:12.507 --> 00:51:14.090
This was like such--
this email thread

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:15.590
is just such a triumph for me.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:18.770
I have it highlighted
and saved in my email.

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:21.350
And this has continued
on since last semester.

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:23.330
I get like one of these
email threads a week

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:26.540
now, with my instructor telling
me all of the cool things

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.250
that they have done.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:32.390
So the last thing, which I hope
has come through in this talk,

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:36.020
it was a lot of work to
get this to happen in 033.

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:39.500
I cannot in good faith stand
here tell you active learning

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.390
is a breeze, you can just add
it in, five minutes of prep time

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:43.340
before the class.

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:44.375
It's a lot of work.

00:51:44.375 --> 00:51:47.810
But this class is
so much fun now.

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:49.610
It's fun for me to run.

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:51.149
It's fun for
instructors to teach.

00:51:51.149 --> 00:51:52.940
I don't know how many
people would tell you

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:56.350
that their 400-person
class is fun to run.

00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:57.910
But I have a great time.

00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:01.340
And the amount of enjoyment that
we get out of teaching 033 this

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.160
way really comes through
for the students.

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:07.250
And I think that's another
component of what has helped

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.990
them engage more in this class.

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:11.790
So it has worked
really well for us.

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:14.150
I hope that you get some
practical things that you can

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:15.750
try out in your own classes.

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:19.310
And I'm happy to take questions
or to delegate questions off

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:21.820
to Jesse and Karen.
